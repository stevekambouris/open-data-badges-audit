Past research has suggested that cognitive reappraisals are associated with changes in memory of emotions. We investigated whether these findings would generalize to an important emotion (love), target (mothers), and time (childhood). In samples of adults, we manipulated current appraisals of mothers to examine the effect on memory of love felt in childhood toward mothers. In Experiment 1, we found significant differences between appraisal conditions on memory of love—effects that persisted for 4 weeks. In Experiment 2, the effect of reappraisal on memory of love replicated with a pretest–posttest experiment. Pretest current feelings of love were biased when recalled after the experiment.

In each of three studies participants were members of a group playing a two-round trust game with another group. In the first round, they observed an outgroup member who acted fairly or unfairly towards the ingroup and then expressed positive (i.e., happiness) or negative (i.e., regret, unhappiness) emotions about this behavior. In the second round, participants played with another outgroup member. Emotions displayed by the outgroup representative following unfair behavior in round 1 influenced participants' allocations in round 2, which were higher following regret and unhappiness than following positive emotions. Thus, emotions expressed by one outgroup member affected interactions with other members who had not communicated emotions. Findings of Study 3 revealed that these effects were driven by regret increasing intergroup trust, rather than by happiness decreasing it. Moreover, participants' allocations were predicted by their perceptions of the extent to which the outgroup representative wished to change her behavior.

Through a half?block quasi?experimental design, a large sample of young adults (i.e. responders; n?=?335) viewed videos of opposite?sex persons (i.e. targets) talking about themselves, and responders rated the targets' traits and their romantic interest in the target. We tested whether similarity, dissimilarity or overall trait levels on mate value, physical attractiveness, life history strategy and the Big Five personality factors predicted romantic interest at zero acquaintance and whether sex acted as a moderator. We tested the responders' individual perception of the targets' traits, in addition to the targets' own self?reported trait levels and a consensus rating of the targets made by the responders. We used polynomial regression with response surface analysis within multilevel modelling to test support for each of the hypotheses. Results suggest a large sex difference in trait perception; when women rated men, they agreed in their perception more often than when men rated women. However, as a predictor of romantic interest, there were no sex differences. Only the responders' perception of the targets' physical attractiveness predicted romantic interest; specifically, responders' who rated the targets' physical attractiveness as higher than themselves reported more romantic interest.

However, because VRAC opening requires cytosolic ATP, it is not clear if and how its activity is sustained in the metabolically compromised CNS. In the present study, we used cultured astrocytes – the cell type which shows prominent swelling in stroke – to model how metabolic stress and changes in gene expression may impact VRAC function in the ischemic and post-ischemic brain. The metabolic state of primary rat astrocytes was modified with chemical inhibitors and examined using luciferin–luciferase ATP assays and a Seahorse analyzer. Swelling-activated glutamate release was quantified with the radiotracer D-[3H]aspartate. The specific contribution of VRAC to swelling-activated glutamate efflux was validated by RNAi knockdown of the essential subunit, leucine-rich repeat-containing 8A (LRRC8A); expression levels of VRAC components were measured with qRT-PCR. Using this methodology, we found that complete metabolic inhibition with the glycolysis blocker 2-deoxy-D-glucose and the mitochondrial poison sodium cyanide reduced astrocytic ATP levels by > 90% and abolished glutamate release from swollen cells (via VRAC). When only mitochondrial respiration was inhibited by cyanide or rotenone, the intracellular ATP levels and VRAC activity were largely preserved. Bypassing glycolysis by providing the mitochondrial substrates pyruvate and/or glutamine led to partial recovery of ATP levels and VRAC activity. Unexpectedly, the metabolic block of VRAC was overridden when ATP-depleted cells were exposed to extreme cell swelling (≥ 50% reduction in medium osmolarity). Twenty-four hour anoxic adaptation caused a moderate reduction in the expression levels of the VRAC component LRRC8A, but no significant changes in VRAC activity. Overall, our findings suggest that (i) astrocytic VRAC activity and metabolism can be sustained by low levels of glucose and (ii) the inhibitory influence of diminishing ATP levels and the stimulatory effect of cellular swelling are the two major factors that govern VRAC activity in the ischemic brain.",2019,2020-02-06T02:40:54Z,2020-02-06T02:41:17Z,2020-02-06T02:40:54Z,255-272,2,151,NA,NA,NA,NA,© 2019 International Society for Neurochemistry,Wiley Online Library,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\9UFBBHYK\Wilson et al. - 2019 - Metabolic constraints of swelling-activated glutam.pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\SHJAG3NR\jnc.html,NA,cerebral ischemia; LRRC8; metabolic inhibition; stroke; volume-regulated anion channel,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000016,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\9UFBBHYK\Wilson et al. - 2019 - Metabolic constraints of swelling-activated glutam.pdf,TRUE

We consider four contrasting predictions based on the existing psychological literature. The first two are derived from the need-threat literature: Following social rejection individuals may withdraw from cooperative interaction in general (aggression hypothesis), or cooperate more in general (reconnection hypothesis). Alternatively, performance of the excluded individuals in cooperative tasks may worsen reflecting reduced ability to deliberate (cognitive depletion hypothesis). Finally, excluded individuals may cooperate less with those who rejected them (revenge hypothesis). We tested these hypotheses in three incentivized experiments. In each, we first varied whether participants were excluded or included in a virtual ball-passing game. In the second part, participants entered a two-player investment game, in which their earnings were partly dependent on the cooperativeness of their partner. We varied how cooperative the co-player was, and measured whether our participants were willing to cooperate or not. All participants entered the game twice, once with an unknown player, and once with a person who they previously encountered during the ball-passing task.

To initiate study of this important topic, we conducted two experiments in which participants simulated emotional events before learning the hypothetical outcome of each event via narratives. Memory was assessed for emotional details contained in those narratives. Positive simulation resulted in a liberal response bias for positive information and a conservative bias for negative information. Events preceded by positive simulation were considered more favorably in retrospect. In contrast, negative simulation had no impact on subsequent memory. Results were similar across an immediate and delayed memory test and for past and future simulation.

Across a wide variety of contexts, we show that when summarizing evidence, people exhibit a binary bias: a tendency to impose categorical distinctions on continuous data. Evidence is compressed into discrete bins, and the difference between categories forms the summary judgment. The binary bias distorts belief formation—such that when people aggregate conflicting scientific reports, they attend to valence and inaccurately weight the extremity of the evidence. The same effect occurs when people interpret popular forms of data visualization, and it cannot be explained by other statistical features of the stimuli. This effect is not confined to explicit statistical estimates; it also influences how people use data to make health, financial, and public-policy decisions.

We briefly review the various terms and uses of ILMs in various fields of psychology and present five main strategies that can help researchers infer causality in ILM studies. We discuss the use of temporal precedence to establish causality, through both lagged analyses and natural experiments; the use of external measures and peer reports to go beyond self-report data; delving deeper into repeated measures to derive new indices; the use of contextual factors occurring during the measurement period; and combining experimental methods and ILMs. These strategies are illustrated by examples from existing research and by new empirical findings from two dyadic daily diary studies (N = 80 and N = 108 couples) and an experience sampling method study of personality states (N = 52). We conclude by offering a short checklist for designing ILM studies with causality in mind and look at the applicability of these strategies in the intersection of personality psychology and other psychological research domains.

We investigated the extent to which individuals with ASD might show a specific attenuation of implicit social biases, using Implicit Association Tests (IATs) involving social (gender, race) and nonsocial (nature, shoes) categories. High-functioning adults with ASD showed intact but reduced IAT effects relative to healthy control participants. We observed no selective attenuation of implicit social (vs. nonsocial) biases in our ASD population. To extend these results, we supplemented our healthy control data with data collected from a large online sample from the general population and explored correlations between autistic traits and IAT effects. We observed no systematic relationship between autistic traits and implicit social biases in our online and control samples. Taken together, these results suggest that implicit social biases, as measured by the IAT, are largely intact in ASD.",2015-11-01,2018-03-20T01:58:38Z,2018-03-20T01:58:48Z,2018-03-20T01:58:38Z,1693-1705,11,26,Psychol Sci,NA,NA,en,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\9TCRCYCN\Birmingham et al. - 2015 - Implicit Social Biases in People With Autism.pdf,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2015,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000035,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\9TCRCYCN\Birmingham et al. - 2015 - Implicit Social Biases in People With Autism.pdf,TRUE

Do we attend only to surface-level indications of consensus, or do we also probe deeper and consider why sources agree? Four experiments demonstrated that individuals evaluate consensus only superficially: Participants were equally confident in conclusions drawn from a true consensus (derived from independent primary sources) and a false consensus (derived from only one primary source).

Because many illusions rely on integrating sensory input with prior information such as spatial context, individuals with ASD may therefore be less susceptible to visual illusions than typically developing (TD) individuals. Yet empirical evidence on the matter is rather divergent, varying depending on the type of illusion, study procedure, and population. Visual illusions lead to neural activity alterations in the visual system. In the so-called Kanizsa illusion, these are likely caused by top-down feedback to V1. Here we tested the hypothesis that a reduced susceptibility to illusions in ASD would manifest as diminished modulation of V1 activity by illusions, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We presented 22 adolescents with ASD and 22 age-, gender-, and intelligence-matched TD controls with displays that consisted of three circular inducers. These either formed an illusory triangle (Kanizsa illusion) or not. We identified regions in primary visual cortex (V1) that corresponded to (the visual field locations of) the illusory triangle and its inducers, and recorded their visual response. Previous research in healthy volunteers has shown a specific pattern of up- and down-regulation in regions of V1 that process the shape and inducers, respectively. Here, we replicated this pattern of up- and downregulation in V1, in both the TD and ASD groups, with no differences between groups. This suggests that illusory shape processing in primary visual cortex is equally present in ASD, suggesting unimpaired processing of spatial context.",2019-08-01,2020-01-30T07:17:12Z,2020-01-30T07:17:33Z,2020-01-30T07:17:12Z,247-256,NA,117,Cortex,NA,NA,en,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\R4VWTVN4\Utzerath et al. - 2019 - No evidence for altered up- and downregulation of .pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\EP5B9TS4\S0010945219301236.html,NA,fMRI; Autism spectrum disorder; Hypoprior; Illusions; Perception,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000037,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\R4VWTVN4\Utzerath et al. - 2019 - No evidence for altered up- and downregulation of .pdf,TRUE

In Study 1, we present a reanalysis of their data using what we argue are more theoretically appropriate methods (bifactor exploratory structural equation modelling) that support use of a global self-compassion factor (explaining 94% of item variance) over separate factors representing compassionate and reduced uncompassionate self-responding. While self-compassion evidenced a large correlation with neuroticism and depression and a small correlation with anxiety, it explained meaningful incremental validity in life satisfaction compared with neuroticism, depression, and anxiety.

Rather than use unsupervised methods to recover a latent dimension that best explains patterns in giving, donation patterns are instead mapped onto a target measure of legislative voting behavior. Supervised models significantly outperform alternative measures of ideology in predicting legislative voting behavior. Fundraising prior to entering office provides a highly informative signal about future voting behavior. Impressively, forecasts based on fundraising as a nonincumbent predict future voting behavior as accurately as in-sample forecasts based on votes cast during a legislator's first 2 years in Congress.

But what enables people to be interpersonally responsive to others? In the current study, we argued that responsiveness requires not only accurate understanding but also compassionate motivation. Specifically, we hypothesized that understanding another person’s thoughts and feelings (empathic accuracy) would foster responsive behavior only when paired with benevolent motivation (empathic concern). To test this idea, we asked couples (N = 91) to discuss a personal or relationship stressor; we then assessed empathic accuracy, empathic concern, and responsive behavior. As predicted, when listeners’ empathic concern was high, empathic accuracy facilitated responsiveness; but when empathic concern was low, empathic accuracy was unhelpful (and possibly harmful) for responsiveness.

In two experiments (N=814; N=809), organizational structure (hierarchical vs. non-hierarchical) and membership (baseline vs. minority) were manipulated. Stronger preference for maintaining inequality was associated with increased desire to limit a minority organization's access to power, specifically when that organization was hierarchical.

We examined the effects of different (i) methods for rating of real people (Revised NEO Personality Inventory vs. NCS) and national stereotypes (NCS); (ii) norms for converting raw scores into T-scores (Russian vs. international norms); and (iii) correlation techniques (intraclass correlations vs. Pearson correlations vs. rank-order correlations) on the resulting agreement between the ratings of national stereotypes and real people.

We investigated the contribution of two cues that may help infants break into the syntax and give a boost to their lexical acquisition: phrasal prosody (speech melody) and function words, both of which are accessible early in life and correlate with syntactic structure in the world’s languages. We show that 18-month-old infants use prosody and function words to recover sentences’ syntactic structure, which in turn constrains the possible meanings of novel words: Participants (N = 48 in each of two experiments) interpreted a novel word as referring to either an object or an action, given its position within the prosodic-syntactic structure of sentences.",2019-03,2019-04-06T18:59:25Z,2019-04-06T18:59:43Z,2019-04-06T18:59:25Z,319-332,3,30,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,Crossref,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\8QW97QR2\de Carvalho e.a. - 2019 - Prosody and Function Words Cue the Acquisition of .pdf,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,a000045,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\8QW97QR2\de Carvalho e.a. - 2019 - Prosody and Function Words Cue the Acquisition of .pdf,TRUE

Most researchers, however, have focused on unidimensional rather than multidimensional conceptualizations of self-esteem. The paucity of empirical research is surprising given conflicting theoretical perspectives on the stability of self-esteem. The goal of the present study was to thoroughly disentangle different conceptualizations of self-esteem and test opposing classical theories on (i) the stability and (ii) the direction of mutual influence of these different forms of self-esteem. We analysed two-year longitudinal data from participants (N = 644 at T1, N = 241 at T2) with an average age of 47.0 years (SD = 12.4). Analyses using a latent variable approach revealed that the domains of self-esteem were relatively stable in terms of rank order and mean levels. In fact, the size of the stability coefficients was comparable to that of other trait measures that have been reported in the literature and paralleled the stability observed for global self-esteem. Results did not provide support for either top-down or bottom-up effects between domain-specific and global self-esteem.

However, according to the Evaluative Model of Normative Appeals (EMNA), between these two processes we carry out an evaluation (normative appraisal) that strongly influences the decision that is ultimately made.

We here present the results of a systematic review to investigate how the standards in this field changed over the 10-year period during which the guidelines were first published (2007) and updated (2010). Methods We searched for papers reporting ALS research on SOD1 (superoxide dismutase 1) mice published between 2005 and 2015 on the ISI Web of Science database, resulting in a sample of 569 papers to review, after triage. Two scores—one for methodological quality, one for regulatory compliance—were built from weighted sums of separate sets of items, and subjected to multivariable regression analysis, to assess how these related to publication year, type of study, country of origin and journal. Results Reporting standards improved over time. Of papers published after the first ALS guidelines were made public, fewer than 9% referred specifically to these. Of key research parameters, only three (genetic background, number of transgenes and group size) were reported in >50% of the papers. Information on housing conditions, randomisation and blinding was absent in over two-thirds of the papers. Group size was among the best reported parameters, but the majority reported using fewer than the recommended sample size and only two studies clearly justified group size. Conclusions General methodological standards improved gradually over a period of 8–10 years, but remained generally comparable with related fields with no specific guidelines, except with regard to severity. Only 11% of ALS studies were classified in the highest severity level (animals allowed to reach death or moribund stages), substantially below the proportion in studies of comparable neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington’s. The existence of field-specific guidelines, although a welcome indication of concern, seems insufficient to ensure adherence to high methodological standards. Other mechanisms may be required to improve methodological and welfare standards.",2019-08-01,2020-01-28T06:46:37Z,2020-01-28T06:47:03Z,2020-01-28T06:46:37Z,NA,1,3,NA,"Methodological standards, quality of reporting and regulatory compliance in animal research on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis",NA,en,"© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

In this study, we systematically investigated the correspondence between auditory number words and visual Arabic digits in adults. Auditory number words and visual Arabic digits were presented concurrently or sequentially and participants had to indicate whether they described the same quantity. We manipulated the stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs) between the two stimuli (Experiment 1: −500 ms to +500 ms; Experiment 2: −200 ms to +200 ms). In both experiments, we found a significant cross-modal distance effect. This effect was strongest for simultaneous stimulus presentation and decreased with increasing SOAs. Numerical distance emerged as the most consistent significant predictor overall, in particular for simultaneous presentation. However, physical similarity between the stimuli was often a significant predictor of response times in addition to numerical distance, and at longer SOAs, physical similarity between the stimuli was the only significant predictor. This shows that SOA modulates the extent to which participants access quantity representations. Our results thus support the idea that a semantic quantity representation of auditory and visual numerical symbols is activated when participants perform a concurrent matching task, while at longer SOAs participants are more likely to rely on physical similarity between the stimuli. We also investigated whether individual differences in the efficiency of the cross-modal processing were related to differences in mathematical performance. Our results are inconclusive about whether the efficiency of cross-format numerical correspondence is related to mathematical competence in adults.",2019-11-01,2020-02-05T06:22:43Z,2020-02-05T06:22:54Z,2020-02-05T06:22:43Z,2632-2646,11,72,Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology,Arabic digits and spoken number words,NA,en,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\ECMPQNCF\Lin and Göbel - 2019 - Arabic digits and spoken number words Timing modu.pdf,NA,NA,cross-format correspondence; Numerical distance effect; physical similarity; same–different task; spoken number words; stimulus onset asynchrony,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000054,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\ECMPQNCF\Lin and Göbel - 2019 - Arabic digits and spoken number words Timing modu.pdf,TRUE

Using two different measures of political extremity, we found that extremists were less influenced than political moderates by two types of experimenter-generated anchors (Studies 1–3) and that this result was mediated by extremists’ belief superiority (Study 2). Extremists and moderates, however, were not differentially influenced by self-generated anchors (Study 2), which suggests that extremists differentiated between externally and internally generated anchors. These results are consistent with the confident-extremist perspective and contradict the unthinking-extremist perspective.

Whereas the Honesty–Humility dimension from the HEXACO model of personality has been identified as a consistent predictor of cooperation, the underlying motivational mechanisms of this association have remained unclear—especially given the confound between the temptation to exploit others and the fear of being exploited as motivational drivers of defection in social dilemmas. In a reanalysis and a new experiment, we tease apart these mechanisms by manipulating the rank order of pay-offs in a symmetric two-person game paradigm, essentially implementing the classic prisoner's dilemma, stag hunt, and chicken games. Results revealed that Honesty–Humility predicted cooperation specifically in the games in which temptation was a potential motivator of defection, whereas it did not account for cooperation in those games in which only fear implied defection. Our findings thereby shed light on the underlying motivational mechanisms of the Honesty–Humility–cooperation link and, more generally, demonstrate how economic games can be used to disentangle such mechanisms.

We hypothesized that pain would occur at a lesser degree of head rotation when visual feedback overstated true rotation and at a greater degree of rotation when visual feedback understated true rotation. Our hypothesis was clearly supported: When vision overstated the amount of rotation, pain occurred at 7% less rotation than under conditions of accurate visual feedback, and when vision understated rotation, pain occurred at 6% greater rotation than under conditions of accurate visual feedback.

This is an important finding for the OFDI literature from emerging markets, since previous studies have researched this relationship from the OFDI perspective of developed countries. However, we also find a weak indication of a potential U-shaped relationship between the strength of IP institutions and Chinese OFDI. To better understand this relationship, we interact a European country’s membership in the Former Eastern Bloc (FEB) with the strength of IP institutions and find a negative moderating effect. We therefore find that when investing in FEB countries, Chinese firms are attracted to weaker levels of IP institutional strength.

We expected this effect to emerge when people are perceived as relatively mindless, such as when they disagree with the evaluator’s own beliefs. Three experiments involving polarizing attitudinal issues and political opinions supported these hypotheses. A fourth experiment identified paralinguistic cues in the human voice that convey basic mental capacities.

Does multiple object individuation operate only over bounded, separable objects or does it operate equally over connected features within a single object? While previous fMRI experiments suggest that connectedness affects the processing and enumeration of objects, recent behavioral and EEG studies demonstrated that parallel individuation occurs over both object parts and distinct objects. However, it is unclear whether individuation of object parts and distinct objects relies on a common or independent neural mechanisms. Using fMRI-based multivariate pattern analyses, we here demonstrate that activity patterns in inferior and superior intraparietal sulci (IPS) encode numerosity independently of whether the individuated items are connected parts of a single object or distinct objects. Lateral occipital cortex is more sensitive to perceptual aspects of the two stimulus types and the targets of the stimuli, suggesting a dissociation between ventral and dorsal areas in representing perceptual object properties and more general information about numerosity, respectively. Our results suggest that objecthood is not a necessary prerequisite for parallel individuation in IPS. Rather, our results point toward a common individuation mechanism that selects targets over a flexible object hierarchy, independently of whether the targets are distinct separable objects or parts of a single object.",2019-12-01,2020-01-30T08:11:48Z,2020-01-30T08:12:43Z,2020-01-30T08:11:48Z,1-15,NA,121,Cortex,NA,NA,en,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\7TF6CSAY\Wurm et al. - 2019 - Individuation of parts of a single object and mult.pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\7MWWBY36\S0010945219303016.html,NA,fMRI; Enumeration; MVPA; Parallel individuation; Subitizing,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000072,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\7TF6CSAY\Wurm et al. - 2019 - Individuation of parts of a single object and mult.pdf,TRUE

The present study examined the longitudinal relation between individual differences in positive daily experiences and the Big Five personality traits. Data came from Dutch mothers (N = 483; M age = 44 years at T1) who completed up to six yearly personality questionnaires and 15 between-year assessment bursts, lasting five consecutive days each. Using multilevel structural equation modelling, we found that individual differences in daily experiences of positive affect and perceived relationship support/affection with partners and children were positively associated with subsequent rank-order changes in all Big Five personality traits. In contrast, we found little evidence that personality traits were associated with rank-order changes in daily experiences, which may be due to the very-high rank-order stability of positive affect and relationship support. Furthermore, positive daily experiences demonstrated incremental validity in predicting rank-order changes in trait agreeableness, emotional stability, and openness, over and above daily negative affect and relationship conflict. The results suggest that positive affective and interpersonal daily experiences contribute to positive personality trait changes in middle adulthood. We discuss these results in the context of contemporary theories of personality trait development. ? 2018 European Association of Personality Psychology",2018-11-01,2019-03-20T17:43:28Z,2019-03-20T17:45:04Z,2019-03-20T17:43:27Z,672-689,6,32,European Journal of Personality,NA,NA,NA,NA,onlinelibrary.wiley.com (Atypon),NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\LLH42N2P\Borghuis e.a. - 2018 - Positive Daily Experiences Are Associated with Per.pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\3UFVDVG3\per.html,NA,personality development; social relationships; adulthood; daily diary; positive affect,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,2018,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000081,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\LLH42N2P\Borghuis e.a. - 2018 - Positive Daily Experiences Are Associated with Per.pdf,TRUE

However, questions have arisen over its robustness and about underlying mechanisms, particularly in relation to differences in past relationship experiences.

We addressed this hypothesis empirically in an artificial language learning experiment with native speakers of Danish, Norwegian, and English. We tested whether artificial speech consisting of concatenated contoid?vocoid syllables is easier to segment than speech consisting of vocoid?vocoid syllables where the first segment is a semivowel and the second a full vowel.

The prevalence of such beliefs might also hold societal relevance and serve as a type of projective test of personality. However, there are no quantitative accounts of post-apocalyptic or prepping beliefs. As such, we conducted seven studies (Ntotal = 1034) to do so. In Studies 1 and 2, we developed a post-apocalyptic and prepping beliefs scale, explored its correlates, and confirmed its structure and psychometric properties. In Study 3, we attempted to activate a ‘prepper’ mindset and further explore the correlates of the new scale. In Studies 4 and 5, we investigated covariations in daily feelings, thoughts, and events, and prepping beliefs. In Studies 6a and 6b, we compared scores from ‘real’ preppers and to a non-prepping group. Overall, we found that post-apocalyptic concerns and prepping beliefs are predictive of low agreeableness and humility, paranoia, cynicism, conspiracy mentality, conservatism, and social dominance orientation. We also found that increased belief in the need to prep is associated with God-belief, negative daily experiences, and global political events. © 2019 European Association of Personality Psychology",2019,2020-01-30T12:44:48Z,2020-01-30T12:46:18Z,2020-01-30T12:44:48Z,506-525,4,33,NA,On Post-apocalyptic and Doomsday Prepping Beliefs,NA,en,© 2019 European Association of Personality Psychology,Wiley Online Library,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\B6YDEHXV\Fetterman et al. - 2019 - On Post-apocalyptic and Doomsday Prepping Beliefs.pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\CJ3JYXBA\per.html,NA,personality; individual differences; cynicism; conspiracy mentality; doomsday prepping; post-apocalyptic beliefs,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000085,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\B6YDEHXV\Fetterman et al. - 2019 - On Post-apocalyptic and Doomsday Prepping Beliefs.pdf,TRUE

We argue that valence-dependent learning asymmetries are partly driven by beliefs about the causal structure of the environment. If hidden causes can intervene to generate bad (or good) outcomes, then a rational observer will assign blame (or credit) to these hidden causes, rather than to the stable outcome distribution. Thus, a rational observer should learn less from bad outcomes when they are likely to have been generated by a hidden cause, and this pattern should reverse when hidden causes are likely to generate good outcomes. To test this hypothesis, we conducted two experiments (N = 80, N = 255) in which we explicitly manipulated the behavior of hidden agents. This gave rise to both kinds of learning asymmetries in the same paradigm, as predicted by a novel Bayesian model. These results provide a mechanistic framework for understanding how causal attributions contribute to biased learning.",2019-04-01,2020-01-29T05:39:30Z,2020-01-29T05:39:46Z,2020-01-29T05:39:30Z,516-525,4,30,Psychol Sci,NA,NA,en,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\3TK8JPT2\Dorfman et al. - 2019 - Causal Inference About Good and Bad Outcomes.pdf,NA,NA,attribution; decision making; Bayesian inference; open data; open materials; preregistered; agency; reinforcement learning,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000089,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\3TK8JPT2\Dorfman et al. - 2019 - Causal Inference About Good and Bad Outcomes.pdf,TRUE

The present research tested whether young children are influenced by adults’ nonverbal behaviors when making inferences about peers. In Study 1, participants (aged 5–6 years) viewed multiple videos of interactions between a “teacher” and two “students”; all individuals were unfamiliar to participants. In each clip, the students behaved similarly, but the teacher did not: She either smiled, nodded, touched, or shook her head at one student, and she looked at the other student with a neutral expression. In Study 1, children tended to infer that students who received more positive behaviors from the teacher were smarter, nicer, and stronger. Study 2 pitted differences in the teacher’s behavior against differences in the students’ performance. When asked who was smarter, children selected lower-performing students who received more positive nonverbal cues from the teacher rather than higher-performing students who received less positive cues.

This research shows that individual differences in self?compassion, as measured by the Self?Compassion Scale (SCS), are positively related to life satisfaction, health and social functioning. However, a critical and systematic test of self?compassion from a personality perspective has not yet conducted so far. In the present study (N = 576), we (i) tested the factor structure of the SCS, (ii) examined the distinctiveness of self?compassion with regard to the five?factor model of personality, focusing on neuroticism, and (iii) tested the incremental predictive power of self?compassion beyond the five?factor model in the context of life satisfaction. Confirmatory factor analyses supported a two?factor plus six facets solution of self?compassion (a positive factor and a negative factor). Additional analyses revealed that the negative factor was redundant with facets of neuroticism (rs ≥ .85), whereas the positive factor had some unique variance left. However, neither the negative factor nor the positive factor could explain substantial incremental variance in life satisfaction beyond neuroticism. Recommendations for how to use the SCS are provided, and the future of research on self?compassion is discussed.

Although such efforts to avoid appearing partial can often reduce biases, we argue that, at times, such efforts can actually lead people to be biased against their friends. We theorize that people do so because they recognize that benefitting their friends may be viewed by others as partial. This argument makes two key predictions, which we investigated in eight studies using workplace scenarios. First, we predicted and found that, when the decision was public, allocators were reluctant to give a bonus to a deserving employee when that employee was a friend rather than a non-friend. In private, however, participants were willing to give the bonus to the deserving person whether she was a friend or a non-friend, suggesting that their public behavior was aimed at avoiding the appearance of bias. Second, we predicted and found that allocators' reluctance to give a bonus to a deserving friend is mediated by their beliefs that others would find this behavior to be unfair.

Are social decisions subject to the same violations, and if so, what account best characterizes the nature of the violations? Across five studies, we tested whether decision-makers exhibit context-dependent preferences in hiring scenarios and past U.S. congressional race outcomes and compared different models of value coding as sources of the hypothesized context-dependence. Studies 1a, 1b, and 1d revealed that a divisive normalization value coding scheme best characterized participants' choices across a series of hiring decisions, and that participants exhibited context-dependent preferences. However, the distractor had the opposite effect of that predicted by divisive normalization once we accounted for the random effect of participant: as the value of the distractor increased, participants were more likely to hire the highest-valued candidate. In Study 2, we used a combination of archival electoral data and survey data to examine whether normalization models could explain the outcomes of congressional elections. Electoral outcomes were predicted by political candidates' inferred competence, but this time in line with the divisive normalization account.

We found that chimpanzees were faster to make prosocial than selfish choices and that more prosocial individuals made the fastest responses. Further, two measures of self-control did not predict variation in prosocial responding, and individual performance across cooperative tasks did not covary.

However, little is known about how trust can be fostered. One cognitive process that has been suggested as a precursor of trust is perspective-taking, but experimental evidence for a causal relation between the two constructs is missing. In the present article, we investigated whether perspective-taking increases trust in strangers and known interaction partners. Perspective-taking should lead to trust, because it has been shown to increase liking of other people, which itself is an important antecedent of trust. In three high-powered experiments (total N = 612), we investigated the effects of perspective-taking on trust using a novel visuo-spatial manipulation of perspective-taking. In Experiment 1, participants reported feeling more trust for a stranger after engaging in visuo-spatial perspective-taking compared to trials where they remained in their egocentric perspective. Experiment 2 supported the above-mentioned theoretical mechanism that trust in a stranger is increased due to liking and generalized the results from self-reported trust to behavioral trust within a trust game. Experiment 3 demonstrated an important boundary condition of this effect by showing that when the trustworthiness of another person is concurrently directly manipulated by giving participants information about how the other person has behaved in the past, the effects of perspective-taking on behavioral trust vanish, and while its effects on self-reported liking and trust remain intact, they are small in comparison to the effects of direct trustworthiness manipulations on self-reported liking and trust.",2018-11-01,2019-03-30T16:52:27Z,2019-03-30T16:52:36Z,2019-03-30T16:52:27Z,34-41,NA,79,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\SZYX983I\Erle e.a. - 2018 - The effects of visuo-spatial perspective-taking on.pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\I2L5FW7X\S0022103118300441.html,NA,Empathy; Trust; Perspective-taking; Theory of mind; Trust game,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2018,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000109,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\SZYX983I\Erle e.a. - 2018 - The effects of visuo-spatial perspective-taking on.pdf,TRUE

Specifically, as proposed by the self?other knowledge asymmetry model, an incremental predictive ability of informants is most likely for traits and corresponding behaviours that are clearly visible to others and highly evaluative in nature. In two studies, we provide an empirical test of this proposition and extend prior research to one of the most important domains of interpersonal interaction: prosocial and moral behaviours. Specifically, we investigate the unique predictive power of informant reports in trait Honesty?Humility for fairness in the dictator game and dishonesty in a cheating paradigm. Importantly, while both these classes of behaviour are highly evaluative in nature, only fairness is clearly visible to others. Correspondingly, in line with the self?other knowledge asymmetry model, our results reveal unique predictive accuracy of informant reports for fairness. For dishonesty, by contrast, there was no conclusive evidence for incremental predictive power of informant reports. This implies that informants may indeed provide valuable information beyond targets' self?reports on trait aspects driving fair behaviour, but that targets themselves are their own best experts when it comes to judging trait aspects driving dishonest behaviour.

In the present study, we investigated whether this effect could be attributed to a disruption in the ease with which benchmarks on the number line can be determined and whether this possible disruption changes with age. Hence, we asked 5th graders and adults to perform a NLE task in a typical and an atypical condition with a number line ranging from 0 to 1,000 and from 367 to 1,367, respectively. Results showed that participants’ overall estimates were less accurate in the atypical condition compared to the typical condition. A similar pattern of results was observed for the estimates around the self-created benchmarks at 50% in children and at 25%, 50%, and 75% in adults. Moreover, in both age groups, we found a shift from a larger proportion of estimation patterns’ being best fit by more complex power models in the typical condition toward a larger proportion of estimation patterns best described by simpler power models in the atypical condition. Of importance, we also found evidence that adults’ estimation patterns in the typical condition are best described by a 4-cycle power model, hereby extending previous modeling results. Overall, our findings indicate that hindering the application of benchmark-based strategies negatively affects children’s and adults’ NLE performance.

Sometimes, though, initial interpretations turn out to be wrong. How do listeners revise misinterpretations of language input moment by moment to avoid comprehension errors? Cognitive control may play a role by detecting when processing has gone awry and then initiating behavioral adjustments accordingly. However, no research to date has investigated a cause-and-effect interplay between cognitive-control engagement and the overriding of erroneous interpretations in real time. Using a novel cross-task paradigm, we showed that Stroop-conflict detection, which mobilizes cognitive-control procedures, subsequently facilitates listeners’ incremental processing of temporarily ambiguous spoken instructions that induce brief misinterpretation. When instructions followed incongruent Stroop items, compared with congruent Stroop items, listeners’ eye movements to objects in a scene reflected more transient consideration of the false interpretation and earlier recovery of the correct one. Comprehension errors also decreased. Cognitive-control engagement therefore accelerates sentence-reinterpretation processes, even as linguistic input is still unfolding.",2016-04-01,2018-03-20T01:42:10Z,2018-03-20T01:42:25Z,2018-03-20T01:42:10Z,572-582,4,27,Psychol Sci,NA,NA,en,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\Z892S3BM\Hsu and Novick - 2016 - Dynamic Engagement of Cognitive Control Modulates .pdf,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2016,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000119,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\Z892S3BM\Hsu and Novick - 2016 - Dynamic Engagement of Cognitive Control Modulates .pdf,TRUE

This attribution decision influences one's opinion of the object (I like him). Misattribution occurs when the internal experience is triggered by one object (a prime), but attributed to another (a target). The present research used the Affect Misattribution Procedure to examine the influence of conceptual overlap between the prime and the target on misattribution of valenced internal experiences. For instance, would people misattribute the pleasure activated by a flower prime to a target flower more than to a person? We argue that the valence of the internal experience does not enter the attribution process alone, but is rather accompanied by semantic properties related to the object that generated the experience. Consequently, misattribution occurs more when prime and target are conceptually similar. Four experiments (Total N = 3183) supported that prediction, using diverse primes and targets.

We show experimentally that exogenously-imposed culture endogenously leads to variation in organizational form. We prime trust and demonstrate that the level of trust within an organization affects division of labor and consequently productivity in nonhierarchical teams. This evidence is consistent with a cross-country link between trust and the division of labor that we observe in data from the European Social Survey. Managerial Summary Firms vary among many dimensions such as culture and internal organization even within the same industry. Trust is one component of corporate culture that is crucial for cooperation within organizations. In this paper, we show that the trust dimension of corporate culture can affect firm performance through internal structure, in particular the degree of division of labor. Using evidence from a game-theoretic model, a lab experiment, and country-level data, we show that an increase in trust leads to increased worker specialization. Our results suggest that increasing trust in work environments where division of labor is beneficial is one way to boost team productivity.

Whereas equivalence accounts suggest that anger and disgust are interchangeable expressions of condemnation, sociofunctional accounts suggest that they have distinct antecedents and consequences. We tested these accounts by investigating whether anger and disgust vary depending on the costs imposed by moral violations and whether they differentially correspond with aggressive tendencies. Results across four studies favor a sociofunctional account: When the target of a moral violation shifts from the self to another person, anger decreases, but disgust increases. Whereas anger is associated with high-cost, direct aggression, disgust is associated with less costly indirect aggression.

To investigate the role of age in this diversity, the present study examined whether emerging adults differ from an older group of young adults in their Big Five personality development. By means of multi-group latent change modelling, two groups of 16- to 19-year-olds (n = 3555) and 26- to 29-year-olds (n = 2621) were tracked over the course of four years and compared regarding four aspects of personality change: mean-level change, rank-order change, inter-individual differences in change, and profile change. In addition, age-differential socialization effects associated with six first-time life events were investigated. Analyses revealed substantial age differences in all four aspects of change. As expected, emerging adults showed greater change and diversity in change than young adults. However, the six life events had no age-differential impact on change in single traits and Big Five profiles. Overall, the results indicate that age differences should be considered even in specific life stages to advance the understanding of personality development. © 2018 European Association of Personality Psychology",2019,2020-01-30T12:40:49Z,2020-01-30T12:43:11Z,2020-01-30T12:40:49Z,245-263,3,33,NA,Personality Development in Emerging and Young Adulthood,NA,en,© 2018 European Association of Personality Psychology,Wiley Online Library,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\NBB5UTSL\Pusch et al. - 2019 - Personality Development in Emerging and Young Adul.pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\ZGTRTKAU\per.html,NA,personality development; differential development; emerging adulthood; life events; young adulthood,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000132,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\NBB5UTSL\Pusch et al. - 2019 - Personality Development in Emerging and Young Adul.pdf,TRUE

Given this relationship, interventions designed to increase students’ growth mind-sets—thereby increasing their academic achievement—have been implemented in schools around the world.

Five experiments (involving 1,320 experts and amateurs in real-estate, jewelry, car, and human-resources negotiations) showed that increasing the precision of an opening offer had positive linear effects for amateurs but inverted-U-shaped effects for experts. Anchor precision backfired because experts saw too much precision as reflecting a lack of competence. This negative effect held unless first movers gave rationales that boosted experts’ perception of their competence. Statistical mediation and experimental moderation established the critical role of competence attributions. This research disentangles competing theoretical accounts (attribution of competence vs. scale granularity) and qualifies two putative truisms: that anchors affect experts and amateurs equally, and that more precise prices are linearly more potent anchors.

Though these modeling choices are intended to address common problems encountered when conducting experiments, they can bias estimates of causal effects. Moreover, problems associated with conditioning on posttreatment variables remain largely unrecognized in the field, which we show frequently publishes experimental studies using these practices in our discipline's most prestigious journals.

The present study investigated the clinical applicability of these factors to naming treatment in aphasia. Prior studies have shown that naming treatment that provides retrieval practice (i.e., practice retrieving names for objects from semantic memory) improves later naming performance in people with aphasia (PWA) more so than repetition training. Repetition training is a common form of naming treatment that can support errorless production of names for objects, but it does not provide retrieval practice. Prior work has also demonstrated enhanced naming treatment benefit in PWA when an item's training trials are separated by multiple intervening trials (i.e., spacing) compared to only one intervening trial (i.e., massing). However, in those studies, items were only trained in one session. Also, the effects of the learning factors were probed after one day and one week. The goal of the present study was to examine the effects of retrieval practice and spacing in a more clinically-inspired schedule of delivery and to assess the effects of the learning factors at retention intervals of greater functional significance. Matched sets of errorful items for each of four PWA were presented for multiple trials of retrieval practice or repetition in a spaced or massed schedule in each of multiple training sessions. Mixed regression analyses revealed that retrieval practice outperformed repetition, and spacing outperformed massing, at an initial post-treatment test administered after one week. Furthermore, the advantage for retrieval practice over repetition persisted at a follow-up test administered after one month.

We showed that a mutualism model, which proposes that basic cognitive abilities directly and positively interact during development, provides the best account of developmental changes. We found that individuals with higher scores in vocabulary showed greater gains in matrix reasoning and vice versa. These dynamic coupling pathways are not predicted by other accounts and provide a novel mechanistic window into cognitive development.",2017-10-01,2018-03-20T00:01:25Z,2018-03-20T00:02:14Z,2018-03-20T00:01:25Z,1419-1431,10,28,Psychol Sci,NA,NA,en,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\AMYIAJXF\Kievit et al. - 2017 - Mutualistic Coupling Between Vocabulary and Reason.pdf,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,2017,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000146,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\AMYIAJXF\Kievit et al. - 2017 - Mutualistic Coupling Between Vocabulary and Reason.pdf,TRUE

We integrated theory on the functional benefits of group membership with a process termed the innuendo effect (Kervyn et al., 2012) to test how the absence of warmth or competence information shapes desire for group membership. Across three studies (Study 1a, N = 185; Study 1b, N = 359; Study 2, N = 429), we used an experimental vignette methodology in which people were randomly assigned to read descriptions that either emphasized an affiliation (i.e., intimacy group) or achievement (i.e., task group) context, and then subsequently emphasized a group's warmth, competence, or generally positive characteristics (i.e., control condition). For evaluations of both intimacy and task groups relative to a control condition, groups were perceived to lack warmth when described as highly competent, and groups were perceived to lack competence when described as highly warm. Though the direct effect of using innuendo on desire to join produced mixed results across studies, the mediation analyses in Studies 1b and 2 show that providing positive information about a group's warmth or competence, but omitting the contextually salient dimension of social perception (i.e., omission of warmth for intimacy groups and competence for task groups), indirectly weakened people's desire to join the group. Overall, this suggests that the innuendo effect generalizes to judgments of voluntary small groups, highlighting that failing to provide information about one of the dimensions of social perception (i.e., warmth or competence) can promote less favorable evaluations on that omitted dimension – even when descriptions contain wholly positive information.",2019-11-01,2020-02-06T01:56:29Z,2020-02-10T04:54:44Z,2020-02-06T01:56:28Z,103854,NA,85,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,NA,NA,en,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\D4VAUK2N\Benson et al. - 2019 - How innuendo shapes impressions of task and intima.pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\D24YF7H3\S0022103119301635.html,NA,Communication; Competence; Groups; Innuendo effect; Warmth,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000148,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\D4VAUK2N\Benson et al. - 2019 - How innuendo shapes impressions of task and intima.pdf,TRUE

This preference is particularly strong among perceivers who have experience in the performance domain, and it replicates across different domains and participant populations. Strivers are also preferred as cooperative partners and are expected to perform better on novel, unrelated tasks. The direction of the preference for naturals versus strivers can be traced to a combination of the perceiver's experience and the target's professional status. Specifically, a naturalness bias was only present among experienced perceivers evaluating professional targets.

We ran an experiment varying the politician (by party and race) calling an implicit racial appeal by Donald Trump racist.

To address this knowledge gap, we measured blindsight, and assessed the perceptual experience in the contralesional visual field, of seventeen homonymous hemianopic (HH) patients. To ensure that the stimuli were shown in a “blind” sector of the visual field, we selected a subgroup of eight complete-HH patients, as determined by automatic perimetry. Firstly, we measured blindsight through a forced-choice task in which the patients had to identify letters displayed on a screen. Secondly, we compared the patients' binary responses (“Something was presented” vs “Nothing was presented”) to responses on a new, five-level scale, the Sensation Awareness Scale (SAS), which we designed to include visual as well as non-visual answers (e.g., “I felt something”). Interestingly, only one of the eight complete-HH patients met the criteria for blindsight. More importantly, our SAS enabled us to identify a previously unreported dissociation, which we have named blindsense, in four of the eight complete-HH patients. Specifically, these four patients exhibited better-than-chance sensitivity to the presence of a stimulus on the subjective scale, despite being unable to identify the stimulus during the forced-choice task.

We addressed this question using the steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP), which provides a discernible measure of visuocortical activation to multiple stimuli simultaneously. Fifty-six adults were asked to remember a set of two oriented gratings. During the retention interval, two frequency-tagged oriented gratings were presented to probe the visuocortical processing of matching versus mismatching orientations relative to the memory set. Matching probes prompted an increased visuocortical response, whereas mismatching stimuli were suppressed. This suggests that the visual cortex prioritizes attentional selection of memory-relevant features at the expense of non-memory-relevant features. When two memory items were probed simultaneously, visuocortical amplification alternated between the two stimuli at a rate of 3 Hz to 4 Hz, consistent with the rate of attentional sampling of sensory events from the external world.

In the present research, we developed a Bayesian statistical model that measures the degree of abstraction implicit in children’s early use of the determiners “a” and “the.” Our work revealed that many previously used corpora are too small to allow researchers to judge between these theoretical positions. However, several data sets, including the Speechome corpus—a new ultra-dense data set for one child—showed evidence of low initial levels of productivity and higher levels later in development.

This experiment (N = 68) explored this possibility by requiring individuals with and without MDD to complete a cued-recall task that required retrieval of specific, single-incident memories to a block of cues; retrieval of categoric, general memories to a block of cues; and to alternate between retrieval of specific and general memories for a block of cues. Results demonstrated that relative to never-depressed controls, individuals with MDD experience reduced recall of both specific (d = 0.48) and general memories (d = 1.00) along with reduced flexibility in alternating between specific and general memories (d = 0.90).

In particular, this work focuses on the identification of stable associations between personality on the factor and facet level, fluid intelligence, demography and app usage in 16 distinct categories. A total of 137 subjects (87 women and 50 men), with an average age of 24 (SD = 4.72), participated in a 90?min psychometric lab session as well as in a subsequent 60?day data logging study in the field. Our data suggest that personality traits predict mobile application usage in several specific categories such as communication, photography, gaming, transportation and entertainment. Extraversion, conscientiousness and agreeableness are better predictors of mobile application usage than basic demographic variables in several distinct categories. Furthermore, predictive performance is slightly higher for single factor?in comparison with facet?level personality scores. Fluid intelligence and demographics additionally show stable associations with categorical app usage. In sum, this study demonstrates how individual differences can be effectively related to actual behaviour and how this can assist in understanding the behavioural underpinnings of personality.

Over 7 years, we examined associations between perceptions of being overweight and subsequent health in a sample of 3,582 U.S. adults. Perceiving oneself as being overweight predicted longitudinal declines in subjective health (d = −0.22, p < .001), increases in depressive symptoms (d = 0.09, p < .05), and raised levels of physiological dysregulation (d = 0.24, p < .001), as gauged by clinical indicators of cardiovascular, inflammatory, and metabolic functioning. These associations remained after controlling for a range of potential confounders and were observed irrespective of whether perceptions of being overweight were accurate or inaccurate.

This question is relevant given that many studies suggest that the objective meaning of invisible stimuli can influence cognitive processes and behavior. In an experiment involving 66 participants, we tested how the perceived meaning of misperceived stimuli influenced response times. Stroop priming (i.e., longer response times for incongruent than for congruent prime-target pairs) was observed in trials in which the prime was correctly identified. However, reversed Stroop priming was observed when the prime stimulus was incorrectly identified. Even in trials in which participants reported no perception of the prime and identified the primes at close to chance level (i.e., trials that meet both subjective and objective definitions of being subliminal), Stroop priming corresponded to perceived congruency, not objective congruency. This result suggests that occasional weak percepts and mispercepts are intermixed with no percepts in conditions traditionally claimed to be subliminal, casting doubt on claims of subliminal priming made in previous reports.",2017-03-01,2018-03-20T00:43:32Z,2018-03-20T00:43:47Z,2018-03-20T00:43:32Z,346-355,3,28,Psychol Sci,When Perception Trumps Reality,NA,en,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,"C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\VPS22LUQ\Sand and Nilsson - 2017 - When Perception Trumps Reality Perceived, Not Obj.pdf",NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2017,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000169,"C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\VPS22LUQ\Sand and Nilsson - 2017 - When Perception Trumps Reality Perceived, Not Obj.pdf",TRUE

Nowadays such large-scale projects are in fact very difficult to take place, considering environmental, geopolitical, and funding issues. In addition, reprocessing vintage seismic profiles using up-to-date software and tools, it is now possible to further increase their original signal-to-noise ratio. Italian offshore areas have been widely investigated by a dense network of multichannel seismic reflection profiles, acquired by the Italian Authorities in the years 1960, 1970, and 1980 of the last century in the perspective of mineral prospecting. This asset of data has been recovered, reprocessed, and made accessible within a demanding project undertaken by Istituto Nazionale di Oceanografia e di Geofisica Sperimentale (OGS). The present work aims at describing the data recovery and reprocessing methodologies applied to enhance the quality of these vintage multichannel-seismic reflection profiles, and at detailing how to access this huge dataset, that have been made compliant with the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and available through the OGS-SNAP data management web portal.

Instead of in-kind reciprocity—an eye for an eye—negative reciprocity may escalate, taking two eyes for an eye. We tested two competing mechanisms for negative escalation using a modified dictator game that reliably produces escalating reciprocity to others' negative actions but not to positive actions. According to one mechanism, escalation is strategic: a deliberate attempt to deter future harm. According to another mechanism, escalation is reflexive: an impulsive act of retribution without consideration of future consequences. In seven experiments, we find clear evidence consistent with a reflexive mechanism. Encouraging deliberation reduced negative escalation in one-shot interactions as well as in repeated interactions. Focusing on future consequences decreased escalation whereas disabling deliberation increased escalation. Finally, the explicit goal to punish another's negative behavior increased escalation while the goal of deterring future transgressions did not. These experiments suggest that escalation is a reflexive form of punishment rather than a deliberate act of strategic deterrence. Encouraging, enabling, or training deliberative processes may effectively reduce costly escalation in everyday life.",2019-09-01,2020-02-06T01:44:54Z,2020-02-10T11:47:28Z,2020-02-06T01:44:54Z,103823,NA,84,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,Escalation of negative social exchange,NA,en,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\I96DC8BI\Vandermeer et al. - 2019 - Escalation of negative social exchange Reflexive .pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\C6MMUHG9\S0022103119301350.html,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000181,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\I96DC8BI\Vandermeer et al. - 2019 - Escalation of negative social exchange Reflexive .pdf,TRUE

Furthermore, we find some evidence that protest attitude is able to account for the effects of mobilization messages over a political issue; these messages increase political action tendencies by making attitude towards protest more positive. The results indicate that overall attitude toward protest reflects a wide array of affective, cognitive, and behavioral factors associated with protest that more specific, established predictors of collective political action do not tap.

That is, people overestimate the chances that whatever is happening now, will happen in the future, even when the (known) explicit probabilities of future outcomes contradict such a belief. This appears to be driven by an anchoring and (insufficient) adjustment process, whereby initial beliefs about the future are heavily influenced by the present circumstances, and then subsequent beliefs are not sufficiently adjusted once the probabilities of future outcomes are learned.

The American Diabetes Association’s (ADA’s) “Diabetes Myths” website provides a real-world case study in such misleading communications. Calling something a myth implies that it is clearly false. Instead, the ADA’s “myths” are false only because of some technicality or uncharitable reading. We compared participants’ baseline knowledge of diabetes with that of participants who read either the ADA’s myths or the myths rewritten as questions that do not presuppose the statement is false.

We first describe the technique in detail and show how it can be implemented by individual researchers on an experiment by experiment basis. We then use a simulation to explore its success in identifying true parameter values compared to current statistical norms (ANOVAs and GLMMs). We find that posterior passing allows the true effect in the population to be found with greater accuracy and consistency than the other analysis types considered. Furthermore, posterior passing performs almost identically to a data analysis in which all data from all simulated studies are combined and analysed as one dataset. On this basis, we suggest that posterior passing is a viable means of implementing cumulative science. Furthermore, because it prevents the accumulation of large bodies of conflicting literature, it alleviates the need for traditional meta-analyses. Instead, posterior passing cumulatively and collaboratively provides clarity in real time as each new study is produced and is thus a strong candidate for a new, cumulative approach to scientific analyses and publishing.",2019-06-24,2020-01-29T08:00:39Z,2020-01-29T08:00:57Z,2020-01-29T08:00:39Z,NA,NA,3,NA,Cumulative Science via Bayesian Posterior Passing,NA,en,"Copyright (c) 2019 Charlotte Olivia Brand, James Patrick Ounsley, Daniel Job van der Post, Thomas Joshua Henry Morgan",open.lnu.se,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\6HNG2L4P\Brand et al. - 2019 - Cumulative Science via Bayesian Posterior Passing.pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\53W5IRIR\840.html,NA,Bayesian statistics; replication crisis; metascience; cumulative science; psychological methods; stereotype threat,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000187,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\6HNG2L4P\Brand et al. - 2019 - Cumulative Science via Bayesian Posterior Passing.pdf,TRUE

If people are naive to this structural feature, then they will tend to have erroneously inflated expectations for the alternatives they choose. In contrast to theories of motivated reasoning, this theory suggests that individuals will overestimate chosen alternatives even before they make their choice. In four studies, we found that students and managers exhibited behavior consistent with naïveté toward this relationship between estimation error and choice, leaving them overoptimistic about their chosen alternatives. This overoptimism from choosing positive error is exacerbated when the true values of the alternatives are close together, when there is more uncertainty about the values of alternatives, and when there are many alternatives to choose from.

Questions about clinical utility, complexity, and difficulty in learning and using the AMPD have been expressed in recent scholarly literature. We examined the learnability, interrater reliability, and clinical utility of the AMPD using a vignette methodology and graduate student raters. Results showed that student clinicians can learn Criterion A of the AMPD to a high level of interrater reliability and agreement with expert ratings. Interrater reliability of the 25 trait facets of the AMPD varied but showed overall acceptable levels of agreement. Examination of severity indexes of PD impairment showed the level of personality functioning (LPF) added information beyond that of global assessment of functioning (GAF).

Thus, at least for some traits, economic success depends not only on having a “successful personality” but also, in part, on finding the best niche for one’s personality.

Previous research has found linguistic intergroup bias (LIB) in individuals’ speech: They use abstract language to describe in-group targets’ desirable behaviors and concrete language to describe their undesirable behaviors (favorable LIB), but use concrete language for out-group targets’ desirable behaviors and abstract language for their undesirable behaviors (unfavorable LIB). Consequently, one can infer the type of language a communicator is likely to use to describe in-group and out-group targets. We hypothesized and found evidence for the reverse inference. Across four studies, individuals inferred a communicator’s social identity on the basis of the communicator’s use of an LIB. Specifically, participants more strongly believed that a communicator and target shared a social identity when the communicator used the favorable, rather than the unfavorable, LIB in describing that target.",2016-01-01,2018-03-20T01:52:19Z,2018-03-20T01:52:33Z,2018-03-20T01:52:19Z,94-102,1,27,Psychol Sci,Inferring Identity From Language,NA,en,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\DZSFYDF8\Porter et al. - 2016 - Inferring Identity From Language Linguistic Inter.pdf,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,2016,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000197,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\DZSFYDF8\Porter et al. - 2016 - Inferring Identity From Language Linguistic Inter.pdf,TRUE

In two studies, with 7464 trust decisions from 359 participants and 2723 reciprocity decisions from 221 participants, we find that loss framing increases mean-level trust, but has no effect on mean-level reciprocity. Additionally, loss framing changes how decisions are made: In the domain of losses, trustors and trustees become less calculative — trust decisions involving losses are less sensitive to changes in expected value and reciprocity decisions are less sensitive to the financial temptation to betray trust. Critically, these changes in the process of decision-making are more pronounced when people interact with a human (vs computer) partner, pointing to uniquely social consequences of loss framing.

Thirty-one patients with acute facial palsy and 30 healthy controls performed a well-established test battery with tasks both for mere face recognition (FACE) and for recognition of emotional facial expressions (EMO). Participants were tested at disease onset (t1) and about eight weeks thereafter (t2). Recognition accuracy did not differ between groups in FACE and EMO tasks at t1 and t2. By contrast, mean reaction time (RT) in the EMO task was significantly longer for patients than for controls at t1 (10.228 ± 710 ms vs 7.386 ± 283 ms; p = .001), whereas RT in the FACE task did not differ between groups. Parallel to clinical remission, patient's RTs in EMO tasks decreased but remained significantly prolonged at t2. Consistent with theories of embodied cognition, our findings show that facial palsy delays recognition of emotional facial expressions but not face recognition per se.

We found that people reciprocated more toward higher-wealth givers, compared with lower-wealth givers, even when those givers were equally generous. Wealthier givers also achieved better reputations than less wealthy ones and therefore received more investments in a social marketplace. These discrepancies were well described by a formal model of reinforcement learning: Individuals who weighted monetary outcomes, rather than generosity, when learning about interlocutors also most strongly helped wealthier individuals.

In particular, it is unclear whether people’s trustworthiness can be predicted from their facial appearance. In the present study, we implemented conceptual and methodological advances in this area of inquiry, taking a new approach to capturing trustworthy behavior and measuring targets’ own self-expectations as a mediator between consensual appearance-based judgments and the trustworthiness of targets’ behavior. Using this novel paradigm to capture 900 observations of targets’ behavior (as trustworthy or untrustworthy), we found that face-based judgments predicted trustworthiness. We also found that this effect was mediated by targets’ expectations of how other people would perceive them and by their intentions to act in accordance with those expectations.

In three studies, we used a hypothetical scenario for transplant-organ allocation to examine allocation to groups versus individuals. Study 1 demonstrated that allocation to individuals is more efficient than allocation to groups. Study 2 identified a factor that triggers the use of fairness over efficiency: presenting the beneficiaries as one arbitrary group rather than two. Specifically, when beneficiaries were presented as one group, policymakers tended to allocate resources efficiently, maximizing total benefit. However, when beneficiaries were divided into two arbitrary groups (by hospital name), policymakers divided resources more equally across the groups, sacrificing efficiency.

When members deviate from group norms, other members often (a) respond with confrontation (e.g., deviate-directed communication or exclusion of the deviate from the group), or (b) with escape, that is, with leaving the group themselves. However, to date, it is unclear under which specific circumstances these reactions occur. Two experiments were conducted to address this question. In both studies, participants perceived norm-deviant behavior of a group member to subvert the group's identity, which in turn predicted exclusion of the deviate and leaving the group. Group leaving, however, was especially likely when the norm-deviation was perceived to change the group's norm, either due to being accepted (vs. not accepted) by others (Study 1) or due to being shown by a group leader (Study 2). Furthermore, norm-deviations by a leader resulted in a lower social identification with the group, which in turn predicted leaving.

While several lines of research provide evidence for grounding of action-related conceptual content into sensory-motor systems, results of traditional lesion-deficit studies have been somewhat inconsistent. Further, few studies have directly compared the neural substrates of action and relatively abstract verb comprehension post-stroke. Here, we investigated the impact of the disruption of two neural networks on comprehension of action and relatively abstract verbs in 48 unilateral left-hemisphere stroke patients using two methodologies: 1) lesion-deficit association and 2) resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) analyses. Disruption of RSFC between the left inferior frontal gyrus and right hemisphere primary and secondary sensory-motor areas predicted greater relative impairment of action semantics. Voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping revealed that damage to frontal white matter, extending towards the inferior frontal gyrus, also predicted greater relative impairment of action semantics. On the other hand, damage to the left anterior middle temporal gyrus significantly impaired the more abstract category relative to action. These findings support the view that action and non-action/abstract semantic processing rely on partially dissociable brain networks, with action concepts relying more heavily on sensory-motor areas.

Weather variables consist of temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, solar radiation, and precipitation disaggregated to an hourly time-step. The only hydrometric variable included in the dataset is stream discharge in a daily time-step. Water chemistry data consisted of total nitrogen (TN), total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), total phosphorus (TP), and total dissolved phosphorus (TDP). Samples were collected weekly during the open water season at the same site as the hydrometric gauging station from August 2009 to October 2012 with some gaps (i.e. Fall 2011, Spring 2012, September 2012). In 2013 the sampling frequency was increased to daily or sub-daily during high stream discharge and weekly during low stream discharge. A data overview indicates values within ranges reported for the area. Mean annual, winter, and summer temperatures were 3.5, −10.7, and 17.2°C, respectively. Annual relative humidity averaged 73.1% but was higher and more homogenous in cold seasons. Wind speed was similar over the year with annual average of 4.3 m/s. Solar radiation followed the typical curve reported for western Canada, with peak daily average values around 250 W/m2 in July. Precipitation records were mostly comprised of dry hours with 75.3% of the events being equal or less than 2 mm/h. Stream discharge was typical of the Canadian Prairies; the average peak discharge over the entire period was larger in April (2.3 m3/s) due to large amounts of snowmelt runoff. Average concentrations of TN, TDN, TP, and TDP of 1.54, 1.35, 0.56, and 0.49 mg/L, respectively, were in agreement with values found in previous studies at the site.

Separate groups of participants rated the nonsense words and the drawings on several semantic dimensions and selected what name best corresponded to each creature. Despite lacking conventional meanings, “nonsense” words elicited a high level of consistency in the produced drawings. Meaning attributions made to nonsense words corresponded with meaning attributions made by separate people to drawings that were inspired by the name. Naïve participants were able to recover the name that inspired the drawing with greater-than-chance accuracy.

When individuals highly value their interpersonal relationships with others, they may take the potential costs to relationships into consideration in deciding how to handle conflict. We propose that individuals take an avoidance approach to conflict to prevent disruption in relationships from confrontation. Specifically, the value that individuals place on superficial harmony is positively related to their negative anticipation of relationship costs, which in turn leads to conflict avoidance. Furthermore, the direct relationship between superficial harmony and negative anticipation and the indirect relationship between superficial harmony and conflict avoidance are negatively moderated by the closeness of relations between the parties involved. The results of two studies conducted in workplace settings supported our hypothesized moderated mediation model. Highlighting the role of superficial harmony in conflict avoidance, this research contributes to the existing literature on conflict management and has practical implications for effectively managing conflict in the workplace. ,  摘要: 本研究关注人们在工作场合中如何对潜在的冲突进行感知和反应。如果人们非常重视自己与他人之间的关系, 会在决定如何处理冲突时考虑该处理方式的关系成本。我们认为, 人们之所以回避冲突, 是因为他们想保护关系不被直面冲突所破坏。具体而言, 个人的表面和谐价值观与其对关系成本的负面预期正相关, 进而导致其回避冲突。不仅如此, 表面和谐与负面预期之间的关系、表面和谐与冲突回避之间的间接关系, 都受到冲突双方的关系亲密度的负向调节作用。我们在工作场景中开展了两个研究, 结果支持了我们假设的受到调节作用的中介模型。本研究揭示了表面和谐的价值观对于冲突回避的影响, 对冲突管理的文献有所贡献, 并对如何有效管理工作场合中的冲突提供了实践启示。 ,  यह शोध यह अध्ययन करता है की किस प्रकार लोग प्रत्याशित संघर्ष को अनुभूत करते हैं व उस पर प्रतिक्रिया देते हैं. जब लोग अपने अंतर्वैयक्तिक संबंधों को अधिक महत्व देते हैं तो वे अपने संघर्ष प्रतिक्रिया सम्बन्धी निर्णयों में उसको संबंधों पर संभावित मूल्य का लिहाज़ करते हैं. हमारा यह मत है की लोग मुकाबले से संबंधों में खलल रोकने के लिए संघर्ष वर्जन का दृष्टिकोण लेते हैं. विशेषतः लोगों द्वारा सतही समन्वय को दिया गया महत्व सम्बन्ध-मूल्य की नकारात्मक प्रत्याशा से सीधा सम्बन्ध रखता है जिसका परिणाम संघर्ष वर्जन होता है. साथ ही में सतही समन्वय व नकारात्मक प्रत्याशा के सीधे सम्बन्ध तथा सतही समन्वय व संघर्ष वर्जन के परोक्ष सम्बन्ध पर पक्षों की घनिष्ठता नकारात्मक संयमन दिखती है. दो कार्यस्थलों में किये गए हमारे अध्ययन के परिणाम हमारे अनुमानित संयमित मध्यस्थ आदर्श को समर्थन देते हैं. संघर्ष वर्जन में सतही समन्वय की विशिष्टता को उजागर करते हुए यह शोध पत्र संघर्ष प्रबंधन के सम्प्रति शोध साहित्य में योगदान करता है. इस शोध पत्र के कार्यस्थल में संघर्ष के प्रभावी प्रबंधन के लिए व्यावहारिक आशय हैं. ,  Sumário: Esta pesquisa examina como as pessoas percebem e respondem a conflitos potenciais em ambientes de trabalho. Quando os indivíduos valorizam suas relações interpessoais com outros, eles podem levar em consideração os custos potenciais aos relacionamentos ao decidir como lidar com conflitos. Nós propomos que indivíduos adotam uma abordagem de evitar o conflito para impedir a ruptura em relacionamentos devido ao confronto. Especificamente, o valor que os indivíduos dedicam à harmonia superficial está positivamente relacionado com sua antecipação negativa de custos de relacionamento, o que, por sua vez, leva a evitar conflitos. Além disso, a relação direta entre harmonia superficial e antecipação negativa e a relação indireta entre harmonia superficial e evasão de conflitos são negativamente moderadas pela proximidade das relações entre as partes envolvidas. Os resultados de dois estudos realizados em ambientes de trabalho apoiaram o modelo de mediação moderada hipotetizado. Ao destacar o papel da harmonia superficial na evasão de conflitos, esta pesquisa contribui para a literatura existente sobre o gerenciamento de conflitos e tem implicações práticas para o efetivo gerenciamento de conflitos no local de trabalho. ,  Аннотация: В данной работе исследуется, как люди воспринимают и реагируют на потенциальные конфликты на рабочем месте. В процессе принятия решений об урегулировании конфликтов, люди могут принимать во внимание потенциальный ущерб отношениям в том случае, если они высоко ценят межличностные отношения. Мы предполагаем, что люди избегают конфликтов, чтобы не допустить разрушения отношений из-за конфронтации. В частности, существует прямая зависимость между ценностью внешней гармонии и негативными ожиданиями ущерба для отношений, что в свою очередь способствует предотвращению конфликтов. Кроме того, прямая зависимость между внешней гармонией и негативными ожиданиями, а также косвенная зависимость между внешней гармонией и предотвращением конфликтов, обратно пропорциональны близости отношений между заинтересованными сторонами. Результаты двух исследований, проведенных на рабочих местах, подтвердили нашу гипотетическую модель модерируемого посредничества. Подчеркивая роль внешней гармонии в предотвращении конфликтов, это исследование вносит важный вклад в существующую литературу по вопросам урегулирования конфликтов, а также делает практические выводы о том, как эффективно предотвращать конфликты на рабочем месте. ,  Resumen: Esta investigación examina como las personas perciben y responden a conflictos potenciales en los entornos laborales. Cuando los individuos valoran mucho sus relaciones interpersonales con otros, pueden tener en cuenta los costos potenciales de las relaciones al decidir cómo manejar el conflicto. Proponemos que los individuos adoptan una perspectiva de evitación al conflicto para prevenir disrupciones en las relaciones a partir de confrontación. Específicamente, el valor que los individuos le dan a la armonía superficial se relaciona positivamente con su anticipación negativa de los costos de la relación, la cual a cambio lleva a la evitación de conflictos. Además, la relación directa entre la armonía superficial y la anticipación negativa y la relación indirecta entre la armonía superficial y la evitación del conflicto son negativamente moderadas por la cercanía de las relaciones entre las partes involucradas. Los resultados de estos dos estudios realizados en entornos laborales apoyaron nuestro modelo de mediación hipotético. Resaltando el rol de la armonía superficial en la evitación de conflicto, esta investigación contribuye a la literatura existente en gestión del conflicto y tiene implicaciones prácticas para gestión efectiva del conflicto en el lugar de trabajo.",2017-12,2018-04-04T04:11:16Z,2018-04-04T04:12:06Z,2018-04-04T04:11:16Z,795-820,4,13,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,Cambridge Core,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\VFLCJYT8\Zhang and Wei - 2017 - Superficial Harmony and Conflict Avoidance Resulti.pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\LNEZ9U9V\309A4A25C5B236284E1171BC0DBA5D85.html,NA,conflict avoidance; negative anticipation; relationship closeness; superficial harmony; workplace,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2017,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000233,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\VFLCJYT8\Zhang and Wei - 2017 - Superficial Harmony and Conflict Avoidance Resulti.pdf,TRUE

In seven studies (N = 5,279), we found that transparently irrelevant cues of extremeness influenced people’s adjustments from anchors. In Studies 1–6, participants were less likely to adjust beyond a particular amount when that amount was closer to the maximum allowable adjustment. For example, in Study 5, participants were less likely to adjust by at least 6 units when they were allowed to adjust by a maximum of 6 units than by a maximum of 15 units. In Study 7, participants adjusted less after considering whether an outcome would be within a smaller distance of the anchor.

We test the relationship between representation and legitimacy beliefs through survey experiments on a nationally representative sample of U.S. citizens. First, we find that women's equal presence legitimizes decisions that go against women's interests. We show suggestive evidence that this effect is particularly pronounced among men, who tend to hold less certain views on women's rights. Second, across decision outcomes and issue areas, women's equal presence legitimizes decision-making processes and confers institutional trust and acquiescence.

This hypothesis assumes discrete perception. In particular, the amplitude and the phase of the low frequency rhythm entails a cortical mechanism which paces the access of sensory information into the cognitive system. Evidence supporting this idea includes correlations between the phase of neural oscillations and behavioral performance in perception, spatial attention and working memory. Despite a widespread confidence in the theory, these findings have been mostly based on a varied range of exploratory approaches and inferential group statistics. Here, we aimed at validating the involvement of low frequency cortical rhythm in perception and at providing a clear-cut EEG analysis pipeline. Such an analytical pipeline should support the adoption of a hypothesis-driven framework for future replications and applications. The design, the analyses and the statistical power of the present experiment were based on prior studies in which phase opposition was successfully found.

Previous research shows that very cooperative people sometimes get punished (“antisocial punishment”) or criticized (“do-gooder derogation”) in many cultures. Here, we used a public-goods game with punishment to test whether antisocial punishment is used as a means of competing to be chosen by suppressing others’ cooperation. As predicted, there was more antisocial punishment when participants were competing to be chosen for a subsequent cooperative task (a trust game) than without a subsequent task. This difference in antisocial punishment cannot be explained by differences in contributions, moralistic punishment, or confusion.

Here, we showed that people express different time preferences depending on how they learn about this temporal uncertainty. In two studies, people chose between pairs of options: one with a single, sure delay and the other involving multiple, probabilistic delays (a lottery). The probability of each delay occurring either was explicitly described (timing risk) or could be learned through experiential sampling (timing uncertainty; the delay itself was not experienced).

Participants viewed brief, masked pairs of words and were instructed in advance to judge both of the words (dual-task condition) or just one of the words (single-task condition). For judgments of semantic category, the dual-task deficit was so large that it supported all-or-none serial processing: Participants could recognize only one word and had to guess about the other. Moreover, participants were more likely to be correct about one word if they were incorrect about the other, which also supports a serial-processing model. In contrast, judgments of text color with identical stimuli were consistent with unlimited-capacity parallel processing. Thus, under these conditions, serial processing is necessary to judge the meaning of words but not their physical features.

The VWFA and FFA have clear but opposite population-level asymmetries, with the VWFA typically being lateralized to the left and the FFA to the right hemisphere. The present study investigates how language dominance may relate to these asymmetries. We hypothesize that individuals with left hemisphere dominance for word production (i.e., left language dominance, LLD) will have typical lateralization for word and face recognition in the fusiform gyrus, whereas participants with right language dominance (RLD) will demonstrate ‘atypical’ rightward laterality for words and leftward dominance for faces. To test this hypothesis, we recruited twenty-seven left-handers who had previously been identified as being LLD or RLD based on a visual half field task. Using fMRI, hemisphere dominance was determined for language (Broca's region) as well as for word and face recognition in the middle fusiform gyrus for each participant. The direction of asymmetry correlated significantly between language and recognizing words (ρ = .648, p < .001) as well as between language and face recognition (ρ = −.620, p = .001). Moreover, most LLD-participants were typically lateralized for faces and written words, while both functions tended to be reversed in individuals with RLD. However, segregation between language and face recognition was less clear in participants with RLD, as many of them lacked an obvious asymmetry for faces. Although our results thus suggest there is no one-on-one relationship between asymmetries for language, written word and face recognition, they also argue against a complete independence of their lateralization.",2019-08-01,2020-01-30T07:16:43Z,2020-01-30T07:17:04Z,2020-01-30T07:16:43Z,196-204,NA,117,Cortex,NA,NA,en,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\W8YZFFML\Gerrits et al. - 2019 - Laterality for recognizing written words and faces.pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\GRTJH3TJ\S0010945219301224.html,NA,Brain asymmetry; Face recognition; Language dominance; Lateralization; Reading,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000257,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\W8YZFFML\Gerrits et al. - 2019 - Laterality for recognizing written words and faces.pdf,TRUE

We argue that the spatial scale of competition—the extent to which individuals compete locally, with their interaction partners, or globally, with the entire population—can help settle the question. We built a mathematical model of the evolution of conflict under inequality and tested its predictions in an experimental game with 1,205 participants. We found that inequality increases conflict, destroys wealth, and engenders risk taking. Crucially, these effects are amplified by local competition. Thus, inequality is at its most damaging when it arises between close competitors. Indeed, at the extremes, the combined effects of inequality and the scale of competition are very large. More broadly, our findings suggest that disagreements in the literature may be the result of a mismatch between the scale at which inequality is measured and the scale at which conflict occurs.",2018-05-01,2019-04-06T17:58:31Z,2020-02-11T07:05:40Z,NA,824-833,5,29,Psychol.

For instance, in the colour-word Stroop paradigm, participants respond slower and less accurately to the print colour of incongruent colour words (e.g., “red” printed in green) than to congruent colour words (e.g., “green” in green). Importantly, this congruency effect is diminished when the trials in an experiment are mostly incongruent, relative to mostly congruent, termed a proportion congruent effect. When distracting stimuli are mostly congruent in one context (e.g., location or font) but mostly incongruent in another context (e.g., another location or font), the congruency effect is still diminished in the mostly incongruent context, termed a context-specific proportion congruent (CSPC) effect. Both the standard proportion congruent and CSPC effects are typically interpreted in terms of conflict-driven attentional control, frequently termed conflict adaptation or conflict monitoring. However, in two experiments, we investigated contingency learning confounds in context-specific proportion congruent effects. In particular, two variants of a dissociation procedure are presented with the font variant of the CSPC procedure. In both, robust contingency learning effects were observed.

Accordingly, we investigated the extent to which framing the very same information as either advice or anchor exerts a differential influence on quantitative judgments. Four experiments showed that although arbitrary anchors were given lower weight than advice, they nevertheless exerted a systematic impact on final judgments. Degree of integration was related to subjective confidence only in the advice condition, but not in the anchoring condition, suggesting that arbitrary anchors were not considered informative. Framing the source of advice as a human being versus as a computer did not affect our results. Only the aboutness of advice, that is, whether it targeted the focal judgment item, determined its influence on final judgments and on confidence. On the one hand, these findings speak to the (partial) sensitivity of human judges to the source and validity of advice under uncertainty. On the other hand, the persevering effect of arbitrary anchors demonstrates the dependence of judgments on unauthorized influences.

Prior research has generally explained such preference mismatches as decision makers mispredicting recipients’ satisfaction. We proposed that a “smile-seeking” motive is a distinct cause for these mismatches in the context of gift giving. After examining common gift options for which gift givers expect a difference between the recipients’ affective reaction (e.g., a smile when receiving the gift) and overall satisfaction, we found that givers often chose to forgo satisfaction-maximizing gifts and instead favor reaction-maximizing gifts. This reaction-maximizing preference was mitigated when givers anticipated not giving the gift in person. Results from six studies suggest that anticipated affective reactions powerfully shape gift givers’ choices and giving experiences, independently of (and even in spite of) anticipated recipient satisfaction. These findings reveal a dominant yet overlooked role that the display of affective reactions plays in motivating and rewarding gift-giving behaviors and shed new light on interpersonal decision making.",2018-08,2019-04-06T18:17:46Z,2019-04-06T18:17:57Z,2019-04-06T18:17:46Z,1221-1233,8,29,NA,The Smile-Seeking Hypothesis,NA,en,NA,Crossref,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\EDS8QR2R\Yang en Urminsky - 2018 - The Smile-Seeking Hypothesis How Immediate Affect.pdf,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,2018,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000287,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\EDS8QR2R\Yang en Urminsky - 2018 - The Smile-Seeking Hypothesis How Immediate Affect.pdf,TRUE

A recent theory has proposed that such choice and risk biases arise from an attentional mechanism that increases the relative weighting of goal-consistent information and protects the decision from noise after the sensory stage. Here, using a divided-attention method based on the dot-probe technique, we showed that attentional selection toward values congruent with the task goal takes place while participants make choices between alternatives that consist of payoff sequences.

To better understand replication practice, we first provide a narrative review of challenges related to replication, drawing on recent developments in psychology. This discussion frames and motivates a systematic review, building on syntheses of replication in psychology, education, and L2 research. We coded 67 self-labeled L2 replication studies found across 26 journals for 136 characteristics. We estimated a mean rate of 1 published replication study for every 400 articles, with a mean of 6.64 years between initial and replication studies and a mean of 117 citations of the initial study before a replication was published. Replication studies had an annual mean of 7.3 citations, much higher than averages in linguistics and education. Overlap in authorship between initial and replication studies and the availability of the initial materials both increased the likelihood of a replication supporting the initial findings. Our sample contained no direct (exact) replication attempts, and changes made to initial studies were numerous and wide ranging, which likely obscured, if not undermined, the interpretability of replication studies. To improve the amount and quality of L2 replication research, we propose 16 recommendations relating to rationale, nomenclature, design, infrastructure, and incentivization for collaboration and publication.

Human infants are relatively altricial and need their parents’ attention to survive. Infant-directed song may constitute a signal of that attention. In Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), a rare disorder of genomic imprinting, genes from chromosome 15q11–q13 that are typically paternally expressed are unexpressed, which results in exaggeration of traits that reduce offspring’s investment demands on the mother. PWS may thus be associated with a distinctive musical phenotype. We report unusual responses to music in people with PWS. Subjects with PWS (N = 39) moved more during music listening, exhibited greater reductions in heart rate in response to music listening, and displayed a specific deficit in pitch-discrimination ability relative to typically developing adults and children (N = 589). Paternally expressed genes from 15q11–q13, which are unexpressed in PWS, may thus increase demands for music and enhance perceptual sensitivity to music.

Here we examined a group of 13 patients with focal damage to posterior thalamus on a visual search task with faces, allowing us to test several hypotheses concerning pulvinar function in controlling attention to visually salient or emotionally significant stimuli. Our results identified two subgroups of thalamic patients with distinct patterns of attentional responsiveness to emotional and colour features in face targets. One group with lesions located in anterior and ventral portions of thalamus showed intact performance, with a normal facilitation of visual search for faces with emotional (fearful or happy) expressions on both side of space, similar to healthy controls. By contrast, a second group showed a slower and poorer detection of face targets, most severe for neutral faces, but with a paradoxically enhanced facilitation by both colour and emotional features. This second group had lesions centred on the pulvinar, involving mainly the dorso-medial sectors in patients showing enhanced effects of colour features, but extending to more dorso-lateral sectors in those with enhanced effects of emotional features.

In a longitudinal study, we tested the stability of participants’ temporal-order perception across and within sensory modalities, together with the magnitude of the participants’ prior-entry effect.

A wide range of evidence from Britain between 2010 and 2015 supports this claim. In the British Election Study, deficit attitudes vary systematically with the source of news consumption, even controlling for party identification. A structural topic model of two major newspapers' reporting shows that content varies systematically with respect to coverage of public borrowing—in ways that intuitively accord with the attitudes of their readership.

Using performance-based tasks, we show that triggering events, in which B moves noticeably faster than A, are treated as being categorically different from launching events, in which B does not move noticeably faster than A, and that these categories are unique to causal events (Experiments 1 and 2).

Here, we employed an individual differences approach to test if baseline concentrations of the neurochemicals GABA and glutamate are associated with an individual's response to transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Using a previously replicated response selection training paradigm, we applied tDCS to the left prefrontal cortex part-way through the learning of a six-alternative-forced-choice task. Across three sessions, subjects received anodal, cathodal, or sham stimulation. Pre-tDCS baseline measures of GABA and glutamate, acquired using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), correlated with the extent to which stimulation modulated behaviour. Specifically, relative concentrations of GABA and glutamate (used as an index of neurochemical excitability) in the prefrontal cortex were associated with the degree to which active stimulation disrupted response selection training.

Correspondingly, social mindfulness has been proposed to involve processes of executive functioning and thus of deliberate thinking. In four studies, we tested the influence of processing mode on social mindfulness using different experimental manipulations (i.e., instructions to decide intuitively vs. deliberately, time pressure, and cognitive load). Contrary to the idea that social mindfulness requires conscious processing – and unlike recent findings suggesting intuitive cooperation – we consistently found negligible effect sizes for the influence of processing mode on social mindfulness. This was observable for both, prosocial and selfish individuals alike (i.e., those with high vs. low levels in Social Value Orientation or Honesty-Humility, respectively).

We examine how cognitive capabilities affect competitive performance, drawing on two constructs rooted in psychology and economics. A familiar one is analytic skill, the ability to solve abstract problems. To that, we add strategic intelligence — the ability to anticipate competitors' behavior and preempt it. Using incentivized experiments, we measure the constructs in participants, then let them compete for cash in a highly competitive market. Although the market is designed to eliminate any advantages, whether from market structure or strategic resources, some profit much more than others. We trace performance differences to heterogeneity in analytic skill and strategic intelligence, and show how the two fuel superior performance, even against tough competition. Managerial summary: Why do some entrepreneurs outperform others? How can companies succeed against tough competition? Certainly, some benefit from unique resources, such as patents, and others can winnow competition, as through mergers. But some have entered highly competitive markets, lacking obvious resources, yet managed to achieve impressive success: think Under Armour, Wal-Mart or Home Depot. Here we test how advantage can stem from managerial cognition. We measure two kinds of cognitive skill in market participants, and then let them vie for cash in intensely competitive markets. Some end up with far more profit than others. Tracing the root of high performance, we find it is predicted by a combination of analytic skills, the ability to solve abstract problems, and strategic intelligence—ability to anticipate competitors' behavior and preempt it.

By contrast, how grouping influences the allocation of attention over time is much less clear. This study investigated this issue, using an attentional blink (AB) paradigm to test how grouping influences the initial selection and the subsequent short-term memory consolidation of a target. On a given trial, two red Kanizsa-type targets (T1 and T2) with varying grouping strength were embedded in a rapid serial visual presentation stream of irrelevant distractors. Our results showed the typical AB finding: impaired identification of T2 when presented close in time following T1. Moreover, the AB was modulated by the T2 grouping—independently of the T1 structure—with stronger grouping leading to a decreased AB and overall higher performance. Conversely, a reversed pattern, namely an increased AB with increasing grouping strength was observed when the Kanizsa figure was not task-relevant. Together, these findings suggest that the grouping benefit emerges at early perceptual stages, automatically drawing attentional resources, thereby leading to either sustained benefits or transient costs—depending on the task-relevance of the grouped object. This indicates that grouping modulates processing of objects in time.",2019-07-01,2020-02-05T06:11:25Z,2020-02-05T06:11:40Z,2020-02-05T06:11:25Z,1741-1755,7,72,Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology,NA,NA,en,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\7KHBX8ZE\Chen et al. - 2019 - Kanizsa-figure object completion gates selection i.pdf,NA,NA,rapid serial visual presentation; Attentional blink; Kanizsa figure; perceptual grouping,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000323,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\7KHBX8ZE\Chen et al. - 2019 - Kanizsa-figure object completion gates selection i.pdf,TRUE

In humans, hyperinsulinemia associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus increases the risk for developing AD and both diseases share similar age-related etiologies including amyloidogenesis. Since we have demonstrated that soluble A?42 elicits glutamate release, we wanted to understand how diet-induced insulin resistance alters hippocampal glutamate dynamics, which are important for memory formation and consolidation. Eight to twelve-week-old C57BL/6J and A?PP/PS1 mice were placed on either a low-fat diet or high-fat diet (HFD) for 8 months. A HFD led to significant weight increases as well as impaired insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance, and learning in both C57BL/6J and A?PP/PS1 mice. A?PP/PS1 low-fat diet mice had elevated hippocampal basal as well as stimulus-evoked glutamate release that was further increased with consumption of a HFD. Immunohistochemistry indicated an increase in vesicular glutamate transporter 1 and glial fibrillary acidic protein density in hippocampal subregions corresponding with this elevated extracellular glutamate. While no differences in hippocampal plaque load were observed, the elevated astrogliotic response surrounding the plaques in A?PP/PS1 HFD mice may have been a compensatory mechanism to control plaque accumulation. These data support that A?PP/PS1 mice have chronically elevated extracellular glutamate that is exacerbated by a HFD and that modifiable lifestyle factors such as obesity-induced insulin resistance can contribute to AD pathogenesis.

We asked if concerns for group reputation might determine how people respond to the moral indiscretions of group members. In four studies, participants read about an immoral act committed by a member of their political party. The act was either publicly known to people outside of the participant's political party (i.e., “public transgression”) or hidden from public view (i.e., “private transgression”). In the public transgression condition, participants endorsed having their political party openly denounce the transgressor in an apparent effort to prevent the party's reputation from being tarnished by association. In the private transgression condition, however, they were reluctant to publicly report the transgressive party member, presumably to prevent reputational loss. Feelings of responsibility for the group arising from either identity fusion with the party or being experimentally assigned to occupy a position of responsibility for the party amplified these effects. Strongly fused participants were even willing to contemplate extreme, unethical actions aimed at protecting party reputation (e.g. tampering with incriminating evidence), regardless of the publicness of the transgression.

Emerging evidence suggests that the physical coordination involved in synchronizing one's behavior with another engages the cognitive systems involved in reasoning about others' mental states (i.e., mentalizing). In three experiments (N=959), we demonstrate that physically moving in synchrony with others fosters some features of mentalizing – a core feature of human social cognition. In small groups, participants moved synchronously or asynchronously with others in a musical performance task. In Experiment 1, we found that synchrony, as compared to asynchrony, increased self-reported tendencies and abilities for considering others' mental states. In Experiment 2, we replicated this finding, but found that this effect did not extend to accuracy in mental state recognition. In Experiment 3, we tested synchrony's effects on diverse mentalizing measures and compared performance to both asynchrony and a no-movement control condition. Results indicated that synchrony decreased mental state attribution to socially non-relevant targets, and increased mental state attribution to specifically those with whom participants had synchronized. These results provide novel evidence for how synchrony, a common feature of cultural practices and day-to-day interpersonal coordination, shapes our sociality by engaging mentalizing capacities.",2018-01-01,2018-04-05T23:58:42Z,2018-04-05T23:58:52Z,2018-04-05T23:58:42Z,281-290,NA,74,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,Coordinating bodies and minds,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\QBEZ79LE\Baimel et al. - 2018 - Coordinating bodies and minds Behavioral synchron.pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\KPHRQCYX\S0022103117303931.html,NA,Interpersonal coordination; Mentalizing; Mind perception; Perspective taking; Synchrony,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2018,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000332,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\QBEZ79LE\Baimel et al. - 2018 - Coordinating bodies and minds Behavioral synchron.pdf,TRUE

In Study 2, this facilitatory effect of prior self-control on behavioral intention toward an academic goal was replicated and accompanied by positive implicit attitudes toward study-related stimuli.

Using Cyberball, researchers found participants ostracized a player delaying the game. To aid in systematic research on sources, we developed the game Atimia. In Atimia, players took turns solving remote associate word items and we varied the performance of a computer-controlled player to perform equal to or significantly worse than the group. Without prompting, participants ostracized a poor- versus equal-performing player more and found the poor-performing player burdensome, less likable, and less desirable to work with on a future task.

Here, we examined the behavioral dynamics of a novel, multiagent shepherding task, in which pairs of individuals had to corral small herds of virtual sheep in the center of a virtual game field. Initially, all pairs adopted a complementary, search-and-recover mode of behavioral coordination, in which both members corralled sheep predominantly on their own sides of the field. Over the course of game play, however, a significant number of pairs spontaneously discovered a more effective mode of behavior: coupled oscillatory containment, in which both members synchronously oscillated around the sheep.

To test the functional relevance of M1 to action prediction, we used offline monopolar transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). In four tDCS groups of healthy participants, we administered 15 min of anodal or cathodal constant currents of 1 or 2 mA over the left M1 before participants performed two tasks requiring them to make predictions about the outcomes of reaching-grasping human actions (Action Prediction – AP) or non-human movements (Non-human Prediction – NP).

No change in performance was found following anodal or 1-mA tDCS protocols. Additionally, no change was found following c-tDCS2mA administered over a control site. These findings show task-, polarity-, intensity- and site-specific disruption of AP abilities following c-tDCS2mA over M1.

When people see other groups as different, e.g., members of a different race or ethnicity, the perceived boundary often obstructs people from extending trust. This may result in interracial conflicts. The current research argues that individual differences in the lay theory of race can systematically influence the degree to which people extend trust to a racial outgroup in conflict situations. The lay theory of race refers to the extent to which people believe race is a malleable social construct that can change over time (i.e., social constructionist beliefs) versus a fixed essence that differentiates people into meaningful social categories (i.e., essentialist beliefs). In our three studies, we found evidence that social constructionist (vs. essentialist) beliefs promoted interracial trust in intergroup contexts, and that this effect held regardless of whether the lay theory of race was measured (Studies 1 and 3) or manipulated (Study 2), and whether the conflict was presented in a team conflict scenario (Study 1), social dilemma (Study 2), or a face-to-face dyadic negotiation (Study 3). In addition, results revealed that the lay theory's effect on interracial trust could have critical downstream consequences in conflict, namely cooperation and mutually beneficial negotiation outcomes. The findings together reveal that the lay theory of race can reliably influence interracial trust and presents a promising direction for understanding interracial relations and improving intergroup harmony in society.",2018-01-01,2018-04-05T23:51:49Z,2018-04-05T23:51:59Z,2018-04-05T23:51:49Z,121-134,NA,74,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,Bridging racial divides,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\73DS4TF7\Kung et al. - 2018 - Bridging racial divides Social constructionist (v.pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\QKRN9P54\S0022103117302706.html,NA,Conflict; Intergroup; Interracial; Lay theory; Trust,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,2018,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000342,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\73DS4TF7\Kung et al. - 2018 - Bridging racial divides Social constructionist (v.pdf,TRUE

This study charted the time course of monitoring in monolingual English speakers and bilingual Dutch–English speakers in language production and language comprehension, with the aim of pinpointing the component(s) of monitoring that cause an L2 disadvantage. First, we asked whether phonological errors are interrupted more slowly in L2. An analysis of data from three speech error elicitation experiments indeed showed that Dutch–English bilinguals were slower to stop speaking after an error had been detected in their L2 (English) than in their L1 (Dutch), at least for interrupted errors. A similar L2 disadvantage was found when comparing the L2 of Dutch–English bilinguals to the L1 of English monolinguals. Second, monolingual English speakers and bilingual Dutch–English speakers performed a picture naming task, a production monitoring task, and a comprehension monitoring task. Bilingual English speakers were slower in naming pictures in their L2 than monolingual English speakers. However, the production monitoring task and comprehension monitoring task yielded comparable response latencies between monolinguals in their L1 and bilinguals in their L2, indicating that monitoring processes in L2 are not generally slower. We suggest that interruption and repair are planned concurrently and that the difficulty of repairing in L2 triggers a slow-down in L2 interruption.",2019-07-01,2020-02-05T06:12:22Z,2020-02-05T06:12:32Z,2020-02-05T06:12:22Z,1601-1619,7,72,Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology,Monitoring speech production and comprehension,NA,en,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\SENCPWDE\Broos et al. - 2019 - Monitoring speech production and comprehension Wh.pdf,NA,NA,Bilingualism; error detection; self-monitoring,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000344,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\SENCPWDE\Broos et al. - 2019 - Monitoring speech production and comprehension Wh.pdf,TRUE

Here, we present a comprehensive simulation study in which we examined how some of the most promising meta-analytic methods perform on data that might realistically be produced by research in psychology. We simulated several levels of questionable research practices, publication bias, and heterogeneity, and used study sample sizes empirically derived from the literature. Our results clearly indicated that no single meta-analytic method consistently outperformed all the others. Therefore, we recommend that meta-analysts in psychology focus on sensitivity analyses—that is, report on a variety of methods, consider the conditions under which these methods fail (as indicated by simulation studies such as ours), and then report how conclusions might change depending on which conditions are most plausible. Moreover, given the dependence of meta-analytic methods on untestable assumptions, we strongly recommend that researchers in psychology continue their efforts to improve the primary literature and conduct large-scale, preregistered replications.

The contribution of those factors to protein levels is under debate, as transcript levels and cognate protein levels do not necessarily correlate due to regulation of translation and protein turnover. Here we propose neuronal polarity as a third factor that is particularly evident in the CNS, leading to considerable distances between somata and axon terminals. Consequently, transcript levels may negatively correlate with cognate protein levels in CNS regions, i.e., transcript and protein levels behave reciprocally. To test this hypothesis, we performed an integrative inter-omics study and analyzed three interconnected rat auditory brainstem regions (cochlear nuclear complex, CN; superior olivary complex, SOC; inferior colliculus, IC) and the rest of the brain as a reference. We obtained transcript and protein sets in these regions of interest (ROIs) by DNA microarrays and label-free mass spectrometry, and performed principal component and correlation analyses. We found 508 transcript|protein pairs and detected poor to moderate transcript|protein correlation in all ROIs, as evidenced by coefficients of determination from 0.34 to 0.54. We identified 57-80 negatively correlating gene products in the ROIs and intensively analyzed four of them for which the correlation was poorest. Three cognate proteins (Slc6a11, Syngr1, Tppp) were synaptic and hence candidates for a negative correlation because of protein transport into axon terminals. Thus, we systematically analyzed the negatively correlating gene products. Gene ontology analyses revealed overrepresented transport/synapse-related proteins, supporting our hypothesis. We present 30 synapse/transport-related proteins with poor transcript|protein correlation. In conclusion, our analyses support that protein transport in polar cells is a third factor that influences the protein level and, thereby, the transcript|protein correlation.

Participants' perceptions of perpetrator accountability, support for punishment, level of concern about the bias, and support for various efforts to reduce it (e.g., education) were assessed. Taken together, the results suggest that perpetrators of discrimination are held less accountable and often seen as less worthy of punishment when their behavior is attributed to implicit rather than to explicit bias.

Results reveal that both dishonest and honest people exploit the freedom to choose a partner. Dishonest people seek a partner who will also lie—a “partner in crime.” Honest people, by contrast, engage in ethical free riding: They refrain from lying but also from leaving dishonest partners, taking advantage of their partners’ lies.

We present five experiments to dissociate these two processes by means of a double registration procedure, in which task choice is registered prior to task execution. The data yielded clear evidence for reward-driven modulation of the flexibility-stability balance already at the level of task choices, with higher voluntary switch rates when reward prospect increased compared with situations in which reward prospect remained high. This effect was further modulated by the specific type of registration procedure, suggesting that only deliberate task choices are affected by the reward sequence.

Participants (N = 80) performed a twenty minute learning task with nonwords containing non-native consonant clusters (e.g., GDEEVOO), and were assigned to groups receiving either sham or active tDCS either immediately before or during the task. Both accuracy and properties of errors were examined throughout the course of the practice task, and then practice was compared to a retention period 30 min later (R1) and two days later (R2). For cluster and whole-(non)word accuracy measures, acquisition was observed for all groups during the practice session.

This process relies on visual working memory (VWM), which can actively modify its representations. We argue that this ability depends on a pointer system, such that each representation is stably and uniquely mapped to a specific stimulus. Without these pointers, VWM representations are inaccessible and therefore unusable. In three Electroencephalogram (EEG) experiments, we examined whether the pointers are allocated in an object-based, featural, or spatial manner: three factors that were confounded in previous studies. We used a feature change-detection task, in which objects moved and could separate into independently-moving parts. Despite the movement and separation being completely task-irrelevant, we found that the separation invalidated the pointers. This happened in a shape task, where the separation changed both the objects and the task-relevant features, but importantly, also in a color task, where the separation destroyed the objects while leaving the task-relevant features intact. Furthermore, even in a color task where all items had identical shapes, object-separation invalidated the pointers. This suggests that objects and not task-relevant features underlie the pointer system. Finally, when each object-part could be individuated already before the separation, the pointers were maintained, suggesting that the pointers are specifically tied to objects rather than locations. These results shed new light on the pointers which underlie VWM performance, demonstrating that the pointer system is object-based regardless of the task requirements.",2019-10-01,2020-01-30T07:37:15Z,2020-01-30T07:41:04Z,2020-01-30T07:37:15Z,362-372,NA,119,Cortex,NA,NA,en,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\ISPHUJA6\Balaban et al. - 2019 - Neural evidence for an object-based pointer system.pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\UVQHXAXW\S0010945219302023.html,NA,Object-based attention; Pointer system; Resetting; Updating; Visual working memory,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000361,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\ISPHUJA6\Balaban et al. - 2019 - Neural evidence for an object-based pointer system.pdf,TRUE

First, we conceptualize and measure secular orientations in a new way—not just as the absence of religion, but also as an affirmative secular identity and positive commitment to secular principles. Second, our panel and experimental data allow for the most definitive test to date of whether political orientations exert a causal effect on religious and secular orientations.

According to the action-specific account, perception of spatial layout is influenced by the perceiver’s abilities to perform an intended action. Alternative accounts posit that purported effects are instead due to nonperceptual processes, such as response bias. Despite much confirmatory research on both sides of the debate, researchers who promote a response-bias account have never used the Pong task, which has yielded one of the most robust action-specific effects. Conversely, researchers who promote a perceptual account have rarely used the opposition’s preferred test for response bias, namely, the postexperiment survey. The current experiments rectified this. We found that even for people naive to the experiment’s hypothesis, the ability to block a moving ball affected the ball’s perceived speed.

This article approaches the right versus left libertarian debate by developing a formal model that examines the welfare properties of different interpretations of the Lockean proviso.

In four experiments we investigated the influence of social categorization and membership on economic decision-making and inequality aversion. Specifically, we used a modified version of the Third Party Ultimatum Game, in which participants played the role of responder and were instructed to make decisions for themselves or another individual (i.e. the receiver of the economic offer) who was an ingroup or outgroup member. Experiments 1–2 (N = 173) showed that the participants were more likely to accept unequal-advantageous offers when the receivers were ingroup rather than outgroup members. Experiment 3 (N = 121) supported previous findings and suggested the intervening role played by perceived intergroup competition. Experiment 4 (N = 61) explored the effect boundary conditions. Findings revealed that, even when responder's utility is linked to the receiver's utility, the receiver's membership exerted its influence when the responders were highly identified with the ingroup. A final small-scale meta-analysis confirmed the robustness of our findings. Taken together, these results integrate research on economic decision-making and intergroup bias and suggest that the utility target's membership can resolve the conflict between inequality aversion and utility maximization.",2018-07-01,2019-03-30T16:34:38Z,2019-03-30T16:34:49Z,2019-03-30T16:34:38Z,117-131,NA,77,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\YAJ44I4M\Biella en Sacchi - 2018 - Not fair but acceptable… for us!

In late life, however, these trends seem to be reversed. Because many changes and transitions in older age are related to health, we investigated correlated changes in health problems and personality traits, the sources of health changes in later life and the directionality of effects. Our sample consisted of older adult twins, aged 64?85 years at time 1 (n = 410; 135 male/275 female; 134 monozygotic/63 dizygotic twin pairs), assessed at two different time points about five years apart, and we ran bivariate latent change and latent change twin model analyses. Increasing health problems were associated with decreases in agreeableness, extraversion, emotional stability and conscientiousness. Changes in health problems were only due to environmental influences, implying that the association between health and personality changes was exclusively environmental. Directional effects were largely absent, but health and personality were significantly related at the second measurement occasion (age 69?89 years). Our results support the link between health change and personality change in late life and spark the assumption of normative personality adaptations to deterioration of health status as a means of developmental regulation.

Across two experiments, children waited longer for two marshmallows when they believed that their in-group waited and their out-group did not, compared with children who believed that their in-group did not wait and their out-group did. Group behavior influenced children to wait more, not less, as indicated by comparisons with children in a control condition who were assigned to a group but received no information about either groups’ delay behavior (Experiment 1). Children also subsequently valued delaying gratification more if their in-group waited and their out-group did not (Experiment 2). Childhood self-control behavior and related developmental outcomes may be shaped by group norms around selfcontrol, which may be an optimal target for interventions.",2018-08,2019-04-06T17:55:14Z,2020-01-30T13:10:38Z,2019-04-06T17:55:14Z,1380-1380,8,29,NA,Corrigendum,NA,en,NA,Crossref,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\94A6E8E9\2018 - Corrigendum Group Influences on Engaging Self-Con.pdf,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,2018,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,a000377,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\94A6E8E9\2018 - Corrigendum Group Influences on Engaging Self-Con.pdf,TRUE

Although this apparent fickleness of memory has been extensively studied by investigating factors that build strong memory traces, researchers know less about whether memory success also depends on cognitive states that are in place when a cue is encountered. Motivating this possibility, neurocomputational models propose that the hippocampus’s capacity to support associative recollection (pattern completion) is biased by persistent neurochemical states, which can be elicited by exposure to familiarity and novelty. We investigated these models’ behavioral implications by assessing how recent familiarity influences different memory-retrieval processes. We found that recent familiarity selectively benefitted associative memory (Experiment 1) and that this effect decayed over seconds (Experiment 2), consistent with the timescale of hippocampal neuromodulation.

In Study 3, we found similar effects with a manipulation of the targets’ apparent race. Finally, in Study 4, we used eye-tracking techniques to demonstrate that Whites’ truth bias for Black targets is likely the result of late-stage correction processes: Despite ultimately judging that Black targets were telling the truth more often than White targets, Whites were faster to fixate on the on-screen “lie” response box when targets were Black than when targets were White.

Participants subsequently perceived their emotional reactions to target objects as more intense than their reactions to control objects. Experiments 2 and 3 used a spatial-cuing procedure to manipulate voluntary visual attention. Spatially cued attention increased perceived emotional intensity. Participants perceived spatially cued objects as more emotionally intense than noncued objects even when participants were asked to mentally rehearse the name of noncued objects.

Members of the subfamily Colobinae are unique amongst extant primates in that their gastrointestinal systems more closely resemble those of ruminants than other members of the primate order. In the growing literature surrounding nonhuman primate microbiomes, analysis of microbial communities has been limited to the hindgut, since few studies have captured data on other gut sites, including the foregut of colobine primates. In this study, we used the red-shanked douc (Pygathrix nemaeus) as a model for colobine primates to study the relationship between gastrointestinal bacterial community structure and gut site within and between subjects. We analyzed fecal and pregastric stomach content samples, representative of the hindgut and foregut respectively, using 16S recombinant DNA (rDNA) sequencing and identified microbiota using closed-reference operational taxonomic unit (OTU) picking against the GreenGenes database. Our results show divergent bacterial communities clearly distinguish the foregut and hindgut microbiomes. We found higher bacterial biodiversity and a higher Firmicutes:Bacteroides ratio in the hindgut as opposed to the foregut. These gut sites showed strong associations with bacterial function. Specifically, energy metabolism was upregulated in the hindgut, whereas detoxification was increased in the foregut. Our results suggest a red-shanked douc's foregut microbiome is no more concordant with its own hindgut than it is with any other red-shanked douc's hindgut microbiome, thus reinforcing the notion that the bacterial communities of the foregut and hindgut are distinctly unique.

The results of three experiments showed reduced SoA over thoughts in individuals with subclinical OC symptoms, regardless of the valence of the thoughts. Several potential confounding factors (e.g., suppression, vigilance, general anxiety) were ruled out. The experience of inserted thoughts was related to experiencing thoughts as “out of context,” which partially explained reduced SoA in participants with high levels of OC symptoms. These experiments highlight the importance of focusing on the low-level, contextual, and phenomenological characteristics of intrusive thoughts in addition to their content and appraisals.",2019-01-01,2019-03-20T14:28:16Z,2019-03-20T14:28:26Z,2019-03-20T14:28:16Z,162-180,1,7,Clinical Psychological Science,Thoughts as Unexpected Intruders,NA,en,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,"C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\KQ3XBB6G\Fradkin e.a. - 2019 - Thoughts as Unexpected Intruders Context, Obsessi.pdf",NA,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000393,"C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\KQ3XBB6G\Fradkin e.a. - 2019 - Thoughts as Unexpected Intruders Context, Obsessi.pdf",TRUE

To investigate this question, we analyzed gender distributions in publicly available federal funding data from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada that are specific to cognitive psychology and cognitive neuroscience. There were three key results. First, the proportion of women cognitive scientists progressively diminished at each career stage, particularly at the transition between graduate and postdoctoral studies. Second, female principal investigators (PI) received smaller average Discovery Grant amounts and were less likely to receive Discovery Accelerator Supplements as a proportion of all Discovery Grants funded. Finally, at the PI level, gender differences were relatively smaller for institution-initiated grants (i.e., Canada Research Chairs) versus investigator-initiated grants (i.e., Discovery Grants). It is our hope that presentation of such data, in concert with other recent reports for our field (e.g., Klatzky, Holt, & Behrmann, 2015; Peelle, 2016; Vaid & Geraci, 2016), continues to raise awareness that gender parity issues remain a concern that deserves ongoing attention within the field of cognitive science in Canada.

Christian Salvesen Whaling Company logbooks from whaling ships operating in the Southern Ocean, starting from the 1930s through the 1950s, are examined. Meteorological information contained in these logbooks has been extracted to produce a historical climate dataset. We discuss various instructions recommended by the British Admiralty to observe and record weather conditions on-board whaling ships. Statistical tests were used to flag erroneous values and corrections were made using neighbouring values. Meteorological parameters such as air pressure, air and sea temperature and wind force on the Beaufort scale were standardized, converting imperial to metric units. The data were structured according to the internationally accepted International Maritime Meteorological Archive format, which includes the most commonly reported meteorological variables, including the time, location and ship-related meta-data.

Although monitoring and controlling one’s knowledge is a key feature of human cognition, its evolutionary origins are debated. In the current study, we examined whether rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta; N = 120) could make metacognitive inferences in a one-shot decision. Each monkey experienced one of four conditions, observing a human appearing to hide a food reward in an apparatus consisting of either one or two tubes. The monkeys tended to search the correct location when they observed this baiting event, but engaged in information seeking—by peering into a center location where they could check both potential hiding spots—if their view had been occluded and information seeking was possible. The monkeys only occasionally approached the center when information seeking was not possible. These results show that monkeys spontaneously use information about their own knowledge states to solve naturalistic foraging problems, and thus provide the first evidence that nonhumans exhibit information-seeking responses in situations with which they have no prior experience.",2016-09-01,2018-03-20T01:07:46Z,2018-03-20T01:07:57Z,2018-03-20T01:07:46Z,1181-1191,9,27,Psychol Sci,NA,NA,en,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\RCNRUYFQ\Rosati and Santos - 2016 - Spontaneous Metacognition in Rhesus Monkeys.pdf,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2016,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000399,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\RCNRUYFQ\Rosati and Santos - 2016 - Spontaneous Metacognition in Rhesus Monkeys.pdf,TRUE

We have employed a label-free proteomic approach that allows quantification of large numbers of brain-expressed proteins in a single analysis in the mouse (male C57BL/6J) kainate (KA) model of epileptogenesis. In addition, we have incorporated two putative antiepileptogenic drugs, postsynaptic density protein-95 blocking peptide (PSD95BP or Tat-NR2B9c) and a highly selective inducible nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, 1400W, to give an insight into how such agents might ameliorate epileptogenesis. The test drugs were administered after the induction of status epilepticus (SE) and the animals were euthanized at 7 days, their hippocampi removed, and subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis. A total of 2,579 proteins were identified; their normalized abundance was compared between treatment groups using ANOVA, with correction for multiple testing by false discovery rate. Significantly altered proteins were subjected to gene ontology and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses. KA-induced SE was most robustly associated with an alteration in the abundance of proteins involved in neuroinflammation, including heat shock protein beta-1 (HSP27), glial fibrillary acidic protein, and CD44 antigen. Treatment with PSD95BP or 1400W moderated the abundance of several of these proteins plus that of secretogranin and Src substrate cortactin. Pathway analysis identified the glutamatergic synapse as a key target for both drugs. Our observations require validation in a larger-scale investigation, with candidate proteins explored in more detail. Nevertheless, this study has identified several mechanisms by which epilepsy might develop and several targets for novel drug development. Open Practices This article has been awarded Open Data.

This phenomenon helps us organize our complex social world and ultimately it shapes our interaction with others. The goal of this manuscript is 1) to conduct a systematic analysis of the different types of measures that are currently used to detect inferences, 2) to identify their main limitations and 3) to propose a new paradigm that overcomes most of these limitations. The new paradigm is based on the modified free association task that Hourihan and MacLeod (2007) proposed as a pure conceptual implicit memory measure. This new paradigm simultaneously overcomes the contamination problem of memory measures and the dependency on data-driven processing of the activation measures. In the presented experiments we use the modified free association paradigm to detect STIs and also to compare its results to the naming task and the modified Stroop task. We show that this measure is able to reliably detect STI and discuss why it is more appropriate to study inferences. Additionally, we show that it can be used to investigate the underlying processes responsible for STI and to distinguish it from similar but different phenomena like Spontaneous Trait Transference. This manuscript focuses on STIs, but the arguments presented here apply to any research field that investigates spontaneous inference making.",2017-11-01,2018-04-06T00:08:24Z,2018-04-06T00:08:34Z,2018-04-06T00:08:24Z,243-258,NA,73,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\9AUNDAM8\Orghian et al. - 2017 - Capturing spontaneous trait inference with the mod.pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\D5D6MVRX\S0022103116308204.html,NA,Activation measures; Conceptually-driven task; Inference making; Memory measures; Modified free association paradigm,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,2017,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000401,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\9AUNDAM8\Orghian et al. - 2017 - Capturing spontaneous trait inference with the mod.pdf,TRUE

Participants categorized a colored letter as a vowel or consonant or its color as “warm” or “cold.” Orthogonally to the color manipulation, some colors were eight times more frequent than others, and the letters were in upper- or lowercase.

We compared the effect of memory retrieval and context inferences on short- and long-term retention in three experiments. Participants studied novel words and then practiced the words either in an uninformative context that required the retrieval of word meaning from memory (?I need the funguo?) or in an informative context from which word meaning could be inferred (?I want to unlock the door: I need the funguo?). The informative context facilitated word comprehension during practice. However, later recall of word form and meaning and word recognition in a new context were better after successful retrieval practice and retrieval practice with feedback than after context-inference practice. These findings suggest benefits of retrieval during contextualized vocabulary learning whereby the uninformative context enhanced word retention by triggering memory retrieval.

There is also a rapidly growing body of research focused on extending features of adult psychopathy downward to youth. To date however, the degree to which these features can be consistently and comparatively assessed at these younger ages, remains unclear. This study addresses this issue by investigating measurement invariance of underlying features of psychopathy across childhood and adolescence in a racially diverse sample of youth. Methods Three cohorts of youth (n = 1517) were assessed annually from childhood to adolescence (ages  ∼7–16). Underlying features of psychopathy commonly assessed in youth (e.g. lack of guilt, impulsivity) were examined within a longitudinal bi-factor framework using multi-dimensional item-response theory (IRT) techniques. Differential item functioning was used to assess invariance across development and participant’s race (African-American and Caucasian), using two distinct approaches: (1) traditional item-response theory (IRT) methods; and (2) a recently developed Bayesian structural equation modeling (BSEM) approach. Results Psychopathy features assessed in this study exhibited measurement consistency across development (∼ages 7–16) and were found to tap into the same underlying construct as intended across measurement occasions, and equivalently for African-American and Caucasian youth. Results were similar when assessed using traditional IRT procedures for longitudinal invariance testing and when implementing the more recent BSEM methodology. Conclusions Findings provide the first evidence that features of psychopathy can be assessed consistently in youth and improve our understanding of important developmental and sociocultural factors associated these features during earlier periods of development.",2018-04-01,2018-04-06T00:45:52Z,2018-04-06T00:46:01Z,2018-04-06T00:45:52Z,180-188,NA,73,Journal of Research in Personality,Psychopathic features across development,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\HWUBKS9F\Hawes et al. - 2018 - Psychopathic features across development Assessin.pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\K54BRBNC\S0092656618300151.html,NA,Bayesian; Development; Longitudinal; Measurement invariance; Psychopathy,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,2018,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000417,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\HWUBKS9F\Hawes et al. - 2018 - Psychopathic features across development Assessin.pdf,TRUE

It has been shown that to exploit such environmental stability, the brain creates a continuity field in which objects seen seconds ago influence the perception of current objects. What is unknown is whether a similar mechanism exists at the level of metacognitive representations. In three experiments, we demonstrated a robust intertask confidence leak—that is, confidence in one’s response on a given task or trial influencing confidence on the following task or trial. This confidence leak could not be explained by response priming or attentional fluctuations. Better ability to modulate confidence leak predicted higher capacity for metacognition as well as greater gray matter volume in the prefrontal cortex.

The new dataset differs from the existing one in a number of key respects: higher spatial resolution, longer time series for some variables, improved consistency with regard to the pre-processing of station observations, the use of publicly-accessible ancillary data sources, a revised calculation sequence for some variables and improved version control. This makes for a dataset that is more internally consistent, more traceable and more reproducible.

In two speed-dating studies, romantically unattached individuals completed more than 100 self-report measures about traits and preferences that past researchers have identified as being relevant to mate selection. Each participant met each opposite-sex participant attending a speed-dating event for a 4-min speed date.

Specifically, in the present research we probed how leaning (approach) versus reclining (avoidance) influence a representative motivated behavior—purchases of rewarding foods—in the context of an online grocery shopping task. We also examined a personality—Behavioral Activation System (BAS)—and a situational—construal level—moderator of this effect. Across Studies 1 and 2, it was established that leaning made people spend more on rewarding foods compared to reclining, but only for individuals high in the drive component of BAS. In Study 3, leaning again enhanced purchases of rewarding foods, but only in a situation that induced low construal level. The moderated effects had strong evidential value across all three studies (as indicated by a p-curve analysis), yet the main effects were significant only in Studies 1 and 3.

However, most researchers who conduct priming studies fail to explicitly report double-blind procedures. Because experimenter expectations may influence participant behavior, we asked whether a short pre-experiment interaction between participants and experimenters would contribute to priming effects when experimenters were not blind to participant condition. An initial double-blind experiment failed to demonstrate the expected effects of a social prime on executive cognition. To determine whether double-blind procedures caused this result, we independently manipulated participants’ exposure to a prime and experimenters’ belief about which prime participants received. Across four experiments, we found that experimenter belief, rather than prime condition, altered participant behavior. Experimenter belief also altered participants’ perceptions of their experimenter, suggesting that differences in experimenter behavior across conditions caused the effect.

One soldier fatality implies a 0.13 percentage point reduction in the local health budget share (2008–12). Health budget cuts due to a single soldier fatality result in 76 predicted additional infant deaths 2 years later.

Classical liberalism is grounded in individual justice principles, suggesting that individuals are responsible for their own fate and should be treated according to their personal characteristics, regardless of group membership. Multiculturalism, in turn, is grounded in collective justice principles, recognizing cultural differences and seeking greater equality between groups. The present research investigates how asymmetric group membership in dominant and subordinate groups shapes perceived compatibility between classical liberalism and multiculturalism. A correlational study (N = 141) first shows that cultural minorities perceive greater compatibility between the two justice principles compared to native majorities. A second (N = 202) and third (N = 164) experimental study involving the description of a fictitious society manipulated perspective-taking as a function of social status, cultural origin and numerical size of groups. The findings show that respondents taking the perspective of immigrant groups perceive greater compatibility between classical liberalism and multiculturalism as an abstract ideology compared to a native perspective, and that a low status perspective leads to greater compatibility between classical liberalism and multiculturalism as a concrete policy compared to a high status perspective. Overall, these studies suggest that membership in subordinate groups generally increases perceived compatibility between individual and collective forms of justice.

In particular, observers are thought to integrate auditory and visual spatial cues weighted in proportion to their relative sensory reliabilities into the most reliable and unbiased percept consistent with MLE. Yet, evidence to date has been inconsistent. The current pre-registered, large-scale (N = 36) replication study investigated the extent to which human behaviour for audiovisual localization is in line with maximum likelihood estimation. The acquired psychophysics data show that while observers were able to reduce their multisensory variance relative to the unisensory variances in accordance with MLE, they weighed the visual signals significantly stronger than predicted by MLE. Simulations show that this dissociation can be explained by a greater sensitivity of standard estimation procedures to detect deviations from MLE predictions for sensory weights than for audiovisual variances. Our results therefore suggest that observers did not integrate audiovisual spatial signals weighted exactly in proportion to their relative reliabilities for localization. These small deviations from the predictions of maximum likelihood estimation may be explained by observers' uncertainty about the world's causal structure as accounted for by Bayesian causal inference.",2019-10-01,2020-01-30T07:35:33Z,2020-01-30T07:39:52Z,2020-01-30T07:35:33Z,74-88,NA,119,Cortex,NA,NA,en,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\IU7W4VZI\Meijer et al. - 2019 - Integration of audiovisual spatial signals is not .pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\DDD4PLI6\S0010945219301583.html,NA,Maximum likelihood estimation; Multisensory integration; Multisensory perception; Optimality; Spatial ventriloquism,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000446,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\IU7W4VZI\Meijer et al. - 2019 - Integration of audiovisual spatial signals is not .pdf,TRUE

Across four experiments involving 489 participants, we compared two decision-making scenarios: one in which value information was revealed during sampling (standard) and one in which value information was revealed after sampling (value ignorance). On average, participants made riskier choices when value information was provided after sampling. Moreover, parameter estimates from a hierarchical Bayesian implementation of cumulative-prospect theory suggested that participants overweighted rare events when value information was absent during sampling but did not overweight such events in the standard condition.

Next, they made explicit self-evaluations of their body appearance anxiety. Using both between-participants (Experiment 1) and within-participant (Experiment 2) designs, we found converging evidence that subliminal exposure to the thin ideal increases body appearance anxiety in women. Using Bayes factors as measures of evidence, the present experiments provided substantial (Experiment 1) and very strong (Experiment 2) evidence that social comparison takes place outside awareness and affects explicit self-evaluations.

We call this asymmetry in how average ratings are updated endogenous crowd formation. Using computer simulations, we showed that it implies the emergence of a negative bias in average ratings. This bias affects items with few ratings particularly strongly, which leads to ranking mistakes. The average-rating rankings of items with few ratings are worse than their quality rankings.

The random-effects meta-analysis yielded a mean effect size of g = 1.05, reflecting generally large vocabulary gains from spoken input in meaning-focused activities. A meta-regression with three substantive and two methodological predictors also revealed that adult participants outperformed children in terms of word learning and that interactive learning tasks were more effective than noninteractive ones. Furthermore, learning scores were higher when measured with recognition than with recall tests.

In this longitudinal study, we followed 5-year-olds born close to the official cutoff date for entry into first grade and compared those who subsequently entered first grade that year with those who remained in kindergarten, which is more play oriented. The first graders made larger improvements in accuracy on an executive-function test over the year than did the kindergartners. In an independent functional MRI task, we found that the first graders, compared with the kindergartners, exhibited a greater increase in activation of right posterior parietal cortex, a region previously implicated in sustained attention; increased activation in this region was correlated with the improvement in accuracy.

Here, we focus on the stability metatrait, which reflects shared variance in conscientiousness, agreeableness, and (inversely) neuroticism. It has been hypothesized that stability manifests, in part, because of individual differences in central serotonergic functioning. We explored this possibility in a community sample (N = 441) using a multiverse analysis of (a) multi-informant five-factor-model traits and (b) stability as a predictor of individual differences in central serotonergic functioning.

Participants (N = 143) between the ages of 5 and 25 years completed a laboratory measure of negative emotion differentiation in which they rated how much a series of aversive images made them feel angry, disgusted, sad, scared, and upset. Emotion-differentiation scores were computed using intraclass correlations. Emotion differentiation followed a nonlinear developmental trajectory: It fell from childhood to adolescence and rose from adolescence to adulthood. Mediation analyses suggested that an increased tendency to report feeling emotions one at a time explained elevated emotion differentiation in childhood. Importantly, two other mediators (intensity of emotional experiences and scale use) did not explain this developmental trend.

In an experiment with 447 participants, we examined whether sharing attention increased affiliation irrespective of the co-attended stimulus (the stimulus-independent hypothesis), or based on the co-attended stimulus (the stimulus-dependent hypothesis). The results substantiated the stimulus-dependent hypothesis, confirming that the effect of shared attention on affiliation depends on the stimulus under shared attention. More specifically, whereas belief-affirming messages under shared attention increased felt closeness to the co-attendee, belief-disaffirming and mixed messages under shared attention did not increase felt closeness to the co-attendee.

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) were demonstrated to play a crucial role in many diseases. To give a foundation for subsequent functional studies of lncRNAs in HIBD, we investigated the profiling of lncRNAs and messenger RNAs (mRNAs) using neonatal HIBD rat model. Six neonatal rats were divided into sham-operated group (n = 3) and HIBD group (n = 3) randomly. Deep RNA sequencing was implemented to find out the meaningful lncRNAs and mRNAs. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to validate expressions of lncRNAs and mRNAs. The Gene Ontology (GO) and kyoto encyclopedia of genes a genomes (KEGG) database were used to predict functions of lncRNAs. A total of 328 differentially expressed lncRNAs (177 down-regulated vs 151 up-regulated) and 7157 differentially expressed mRNAs (2552 down-regulated vs 4605 up-regulated) were identified. The Quantitative real-time PCR results showed significant differential expressions of five lncRNAs and five mRNAs which were consistent with the RNA-Seq data. Gene ontology and KEGG analysis showed these lncRNAs and their expression-correlated mRNAs were closely related to the Janus tyrosine kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) signaling pathway, NF-kappa B signaling pathway, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, calcium signaling pathway, Notch signaling pathway, mitogen activated protein kinase signaling pathway, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathway and more. The results of our study identified the characterization and expression profiles of lncRNAs in neonatal HIBD and may be a basis for further therapeutic research.

We found that during economic downturns, Whites felt less warmly about Blacks (Studies 1 and 2), held more negative explicit and implicit attitudes about Blacks, were more likely to condone the use of stereotypes, and were more willing to regard inequality between groups as natural and acceptable (Study 2).

Abnormal glutamatergic signalling within this network may play a role in aggression. However, disruptive behavior does not represent a homogeneous construct, but can be fractionated across several dimensions. Of particular interest, callous-unemotional (CU) traits have been shown to modulate the severity, neural and behavioural characterisation, and therapeutic outcomes of disruptive behaviour disorders (DBDs) and aggression. Further, individuals showing disruptive behavior differ to the extent that they engage in subtypes of aggression (i.e., proactive [PA] and reactive aggression [RA]) which may also represent distinct therapeutic targets. Here we investigated how glutamate signalling within the fronto-amygdala-striatal circuitry was altered along these dimensions in youths showing disruptive behavior (n = 140) and typically developing controls (TD, n = 93) within the age-range of 8–18 years. We used proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), striatum, amygdala and insula and associated glutamate concentrations with continuous measures of aggression and CU-traits using linear mixed-effects models. We found evidence of a dissociation for the different measures and glutamate concentrations. CU traits were associated with increased ACC glutamate (‘callousness’: b = .19, t (108) = 2.63, p = .01, r = .25; ‘uncaring’: b = .18, t (108) = 2.59, p = .011, r = .24) while PA was associated with decreased striatal glutamate concentration (b = −.23, t (28) = -3.02, p = .005, r = .50). These findings suggest dissociable correlates of CU traits and PA in DBDs, and indicate that the ACC and striatal glutamate may represent novel pharmacological targets in treating these different aspects.",2019-12-01,2020-01-30T08:10:48Z,2020-01-30T12:02:07Z,2020-01-30T08:10:48Z,135-146,NA,121,Cortex,NA,NA,en,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\QWQ7A564\Craig et al. - 2019 - Distinct associations between fronto-striatal glut.pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\6FJED2HQ\S0010945219303065.html,NA,Aggression; Glutamate; Anterior cingulate cortex; Callous unemotional traits; Magnetic resonance spectroscopy,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000485,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\QWQ7A564\Craig et al. - 2019 - Distinct associations between fronto-striatal glut.pdf,TRUE

However, given its links to self-control—itself a necessary factor for repaying debts—the possibility arises that gratitude might enhance other virtues unrelated to exchange that depend on an ability to resist temptation. Here, we examined gratitude’s ability to function as a “parent” virtue by focusing on its ability to reduce cheating. Using real-time behavior-based measures of cheating, we demonstrated that gratitude, as opposed to neutrality and the more general positive emotional state of happiness, reduces cheating in both a controlled laboratory setting (N = 156) and a more anonymous online setting (N = 141). This finding suggests that not all moral qualities need to be studied in silos but, rather, that hierarchies exist wherein certain virtues might give rise to seemingly unrelated others.",2019-07-01,2020-01-29T06:05:39Z,2020-01-29T06:05:54Z,2020-01-29T06:05:38Z,979-988,7,30,Psychol Sci,The Grateful Don’t Cheat,NA,en,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\3L3R4BZL\DeSteno et al. - 2019 - The Grateful Don’t Cheat Gratitude as a Fount of .pdf,NA,NA,emotion; cheating; open data; preregistered; gratitude; moral virtue,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000491,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\3L3R4BZL\DeSteno et al. - 2019 - The Grateful Don’t Cheat Gratitude as a Fount of .pdf,TRUE

These patterns may be a result of marked dietary differences between captive and wild settings and associated impacts on the gut microbiome. However, given that most existing studies target NHP dietary specialists, it is unclear if captive environments have distinct impacts on the gut microbiome of NHPs with different dietary niches. To begin to examine this question, we used 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequences to compare the gut microbiomes of five NHP genera categorized either as folivores (Alouatta, Colobus) or non-folivores (Cercopithecus, Gorilla, Pan) sampled both in captivity and in the wild. Though captivity affected the gut microbiomes of all NHPs in this study, the effects were largest in folivorous NHPs. Shifts in gut microbial diversity and in the relative abundances of fiber-degrading microbial taxa suggest that these findings are driven by marked dietary shifts for folivorous NHPs in captive settings. We propose that zoos and other captive care institutions consider including more natural browse in folivorous NHP diets and regularly bank fecal samples to further explore the relationship between NHP diet, the gut microbiome, and health outcomes.",2019,2020-01-29T03:44:41Z,2020-01-29T03:45:06Z,2020-01-29T03:44:41Z,e23061,12,81,NA,NA,NA,en,"© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Wiley Online Library,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\CBLCBW8X\Frankel et al. - 2019 - The effect of captivity on the primate gut microbi.pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\V2X656YP\ajp.html,NA,diet; captivity; folivore; gut microbiome,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000493,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\CBLCBW8X\Frankel et al. - 2019 - The effect of captivity on the primate gut microbi.pdf,TRUE

Over the last decade or so, a number of projects have contributed to the rescue of some of these data. Here we provide a summary of a survey we have undertaken of several meteorological and climate data rescue projects, in order to identify the needs of climate data rescue services. To make these efforts more sustainable, additional integrated activities are needed. We argue that meteorological and climate data rescue must be seen as a continuous, coordinated long-term effort. Technical developments (e.g. data assimilation), new scientific questions (e.g. process understanding of extreme events) and new social (e.g. risk assessment, health) or economic (e.g. new renewable energy sources, agriculture and forestry, tourism, infrastructure, etc.) services are highlighting the immense value of data previously neglected or never considered. This continuous effort is currently undertaken by projects of various sizes, structure, funding and staffing, as well as by dedicated programmes, ranging from those within many national weather services down to ?grassroots? initiatives. These activities are often not sufficiently coordinated, staffed, or funded at an international level and will benefit considerably from climate data rescue services being established within the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) (https://climate.copernicus.eu/).

First, we demonstrated that frontal executive-control areas were more engaged for more difficult decisions and that this effect was enhanced for high-magnitude rewards. Second, we showed that increased hunger, which is associated with lower self-control, reduced the magnitude effect. Third, we tested an intervention designed to increase self-control and showed that it reduced the magnitude effect.

Participants consistently responded fastest to WM probes at locations of self-associated colors (Experiments 1–4). This self-bias was driven not by differential exogenous attention during encoding or retrieval (Experiments 1 and 2) but by internal attentional prioritization of self-related representations during WM maintenance (Experiment 3).

Previous research has challenged this claim by showing that the EC effect in facial stimuli is disrupted when a single feature of a face is altered. As the external validity of research paradigms is vital when generalizing findings from an experiment to the social world, the present research reconsiders this previous work in three experiments. Using faces as conditioned stimuli, we demonstrate that neither changes in viewing angle (Experiments 1 and 2), nor changes in features of the conditioned face (Experiment 3) disrupt the EC effect. The present experiments thus demonstrate that attitude acquisition by means of EC procedures generalizes to novel instances of the conditioned stimulus, signifying the adaptive value of EC effects in preparing behavior.

However, most arguments come from stimulus–response compatibility paradigms, raising the issue of the automaticity of affordance effects. Action priming paradigms overcome this issue but show less reliable results, possibly because affordance effects are moderated by additional factors. The present study aimed to assess whether affordance effects highlighted in action priming paradigms could be affected by object category (manufactured or natural). A total of 24 young adults performed a semantic categorisation task on natural and manufactured target objects presented after neutral (non-grasping hand postures) or action (congruent power or precision grips) primes. Results revealed a modulation of action priming effects as a function of object category. Object semantic categorisation was faster after action than neutral primes, but only for manufactured objects. Results suggest that natural and manufactured objects evoke distinct types of affordances and that action priming paradigms favour the evocation of functional affordances during object semantic categorisation.

The critical ungrammatical test sequences were formed by transposing two adjacent words from either a grammatical base sequence (e.g., “The white cat was big” became “The white was cat big”) or an ungrammatical base sequence (e.g., “The white cat was slowly” became “The white was cat slowly”). These were intermixed with an equal number of correct sentences for the purpose of the grammaticality judgment task. In a laboratory experiment (N = 57) and an online experiment (N = 94), we found that ungrammatical decisions were harder to make when the ungrammatical sequence originated from a grammatically correct base sequence. This provides the first demonstration that the encoding of word order retains a certain amount of uncertainty.

In four experiments (n = 797), women and men made considerably stronger discrimination attributions, and were moderately more discouraged from seeking work, when the victim was female rather than male.

Discriminating between the two is key to every social encounter. We propose that humans turn to internal information, namely the self, when judging the trustworthiness of others. Simulating how oneself would behave in situations that involve trust helps to predict how a counterpart may behave. Importantly, using the same self as a basis for judgments about others may result in diverging outcomes, depending on how the information is processed. If a judge focuses on similarities between the self and the target person, the judge expects the counterpart to act alike. However, if a judge focuses on differences, the target is expected to behave in ways opposite to the self. In Study 1, natural variations in self-ascribed levels of trustworthiness correlate positively with expectations of a target person's trustworthiness. Inducing a similarity-focus increases this correlation as compared to a difference-focus. Interestingly, this effect holds even if information speaks to the target's trustworthiness. In manipulating the perception of the participants' own trustworthiness as well as the processing focus, Studies 2–4 demonstrate that when individuals focus on similarities, those who perceive themselves as highly (vs. less) trustworthy perceive others as similarly highly (less) trustworthy. However, when they focus on differences, the reverse pattern tends to occur. These effects hold for trust judgments (Study 2–3) and trust behavior in an economic game (Study 4). Together, these findings demonstrate that trust involves egocentric inferences that are flexible enough to adjust for basic social relations.",2019-09-01,2020-02-06T01:47:32Z,2020-02-10T11:44:14Z,2020-02-06T01:47:32Z,103820,NA,84,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,NA,NA,en,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\RZKJ7Q4M\Posten and Mussweiler - 2019 - Egocentric foundations of trust.pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\XXSE6NKY\S0022103118308886.html,NA,Trust; Economic decisions; Egocentrism; Judgment; Similarity,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000512,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\RZKJ7Q4M\Posten and Mussweiler - 2019 - Egocentric foundations of trust.pdf,TRUE

They demonstrated that after being told to associate three identities (self, friend, stranger) with three arbitrary stimuli (geometrical shapes), participants were faster in a perceptual matching task to recognise matching pairs of self-associated shape with self-label, than respective friend or stranger-related pairings. They interpreted this as evidence that a brief self-association is sufficient to facilitate processing of previously neutral stimuli. However, in the matching trials of the self-prioritization task, participants are processing not only self-associated arbitrary stimuli but also familiar verbal labels with an established meaning. Therefore, the self-advantage may be caused by familiarity of the labels, rather than self-association of the shapes. To test whether self-prioritization can be elicited in a task employing exclusively neutral stimuli, we asked participants to associate avatar faces with three identities (self, name of best friend, and stranger) and replaced labels with unfamiliar abstract symbols that were associated to the words (you, friend, stranger) before the actual experiment started.

However, the cognitive basis of this data-gathering tendency remains unclear. Suggested theories include that delusion-prone individuals gather less data because they (a) misjudge the information value of evidence, (b) find data gathering more taxing than do controls, or (c) make noisier decisions than controls. In the present study we developed a novel, incentivized, nonserial data-gathering task to tease apart these alternatives. Higher delusion-proneness was associated with gathering less information on this task, even when accounting for gender, risk aversion, and intelligence.

Participants who descrambled mostly hostile sentences rated Donald and the ambiguous behaviors as approximately 3 scale points more hostile than did those who descrambled mostly neutral sentences. This Registered Replication Report describes the results of 26 independent replications (N = 7,373 in the total sample; k = 22 labs and N = 5,610 in the primary analyses) of Srull and Wyer’s Experiment 1, each of which followed a preregistered and vetted protocol. A random-effects meta-analysis showed that the protagonist was seen as 0.08 scale points more hostile when participants were primed with 80% hostile sentences than when they were primed with 20% hostile sentences (95% confidence interval, CI = [0.004, 0.16]). The ambiguously hostile behaviors were seen as 0.08 points less hostile when participants were primed with 80% hostile sentences than when they were primed with 20% hostile sentences (95% CI = [−0.18, 0.01]). Although the confidence interval for one outcome excluded zero and the observed effect was in the predicted direction, these results suggest that the currently used methods do not produce an assimilative priming effect that is practically and routinely detectable.",2018-09-01,2020-01-14T06:57:36Z,2020-01-14T06:57:55Z,2020-01-14T06:57:36Z,321-336,3,1,Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science,NA,NA,en,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\PB3Q3EYJ\McCarthy et al. - 2018 - Registered Replication Report on Srull and Wyer (1.pdf,NA,NA,replication; open data; open materials; preregistered; Many Labs; hostility; impression formation; priming,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,2018,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000524,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\PB3Q3EYJ\McCarthy et al. - 2018 - Registered Replication Report on Srull and Wyer (1.pdf,TRUE

In the present experiments (n = 80 and n = 79), we provided or did not provide participants with the opportunity to recommend a punishment for an in-group or an out-group deviant. We also measured in-group identification before and after exposure to deviant behavior and after judgment. The results show that participants first disidentified from the in-group but, when presented with an opportunity to judge the deviant, also derogated. Importantly, participants who could judge the deviant also recovered their initial in-group identification level.

About 97% of the series are publicly available in a common format, while the remaining 3% can be obtained from the original data providers. Unlike other similar products, duplicates have been removed without blending of series, which simplifies data traceability and improves the temporal homogeneity of the individual series at the cost of a smaller average length. Residual artificial signals (breakpoints) in the series caused by station relocations, changes in instrumentation, etc., have been detected by means of the combination of four breakpoint detection tests, four variables and three temporal aggregations. The combined results give not only the most probable position of the breakpoints, but also a measure of their likelihood. The reliability of the detection was estimated for each year of each target series, based on the number of reference series and on their correlation with the target series. Moreover, its general performance was evaluated through a benchmark of synthetic series.

These comparisons generally suggest poor representation. We argue here that this common design is unlikely to effectively evaluate representation because responses to survey questions differ in important aspects from voting in legislatures. Measurement error and construct validity undermine the comparison. Three survey experiments show that providing partisan and nonpartisan information readily available to legislators materially changes respondents' expressed preferences on roll-call votes. With information, expressed policy positions are both less centrist and more closely matched to legislator behavior in their preferred party. Respondents also appear aware of their own lack of knowledge in evaluating roll-call policy votes. The treatment effect of information decreases in confidence judging policy in that area.

Because humans appear to use social groups as units to explain social activities, we proposed that a socially defined group, according to social interaction information, would also be a possible object of attentional selection. This hypothesis was examined using displays with and without handshaking interactions. Results demonstrated that object-based attention, which was measured by an object-specific attentional advantage (i.e., shorter response times to targets on a single object), was extended to two hands performing a handshake but not to hands that did not perform meaningful social interactions, even when they did perform handshake-like actions. This finding cannot be attributed to the familiarity of the frequent co-occurrence of two handshaking hands. Hence, object-based attention can select a grouped object whose parts are connected within a meaningful social interaction.

We examined the impact of the causal centrality of a feature, a key determinant of the extent to which a feature defines a concept, on judgments of identity continuity.

The microarchitecture of wing bristles limits the use of electrophysiology methods to investigate wing chemosensory mechanisms. However, by monitoring the fluorescence of the complex calcium/GCaMP, calcium flux triggered upon tastant stimulation was observed within sensilla aligned along the wing anterior nerve. This string of fluorescent puncta was impaired in wings of Innexin 2 (Inx2) mutant flies; although it is unclear whether the Innexin proteins act at the level of the wing imaginal disc, adult wing and/or at both levels. Glial cells known to shelter Innexin(s) expression have no documented role in adult chemosensory sensilla. Our data suggest that Innexin(s) are likely required for the maturation of functional wing chemosensilla in adulthood.

Typical adults can do this with covert spatial attention: prioritizing particular visual field locations even without moving the eyes. Deficits of covert spatial attention have been implicated in developmental dyslexia, a specific reading disability. Previous studies of children with dyslexia, however, have been complicated by group differences in overall task ability that are difficult to distinguish from selective spatial attention. Here, we used a single-fixation visual search task to estimate orientation discrimination thresholds with and without an informative spatial cue in a large sample (N = 123) of people ranging in age from 5 to 70 years and with a wide range of reading abilities. We assessed the efficiency of attentional selection via the cueing effect: the difference in log thresholds with and without the spatial cue. Across our whole sample, both absolute thresholds and the cueing effect gradually improved throughout childhood and adolescence. Compared to typical readers, individuals with dyslexia had higher thresholds (worse orientation discrimination) as well as smaller cueing effects (weaker attentional selection). Those differences in dyslexia were especially pronounced prior to age 20, when basic visual function is still maturing. Thus, in line with previous theories, literacy skills are associated with the development of selective spatial attention.",2019-12-01,2020-01-30T08:11:38Z,2020-01-30T12:02:59Z,2020-01-30T08:11:38Z,44-59,NA,121,Cortex,NA,NA,en,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\K8RJMGIP\White et al. - 2019 - The link between reading ability and visual spatia.pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\D3LHPXUT\S0010945219303004.html,NA,Development; Visual perception; Spatial attention; Dyslexia,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000533,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\K8RJMGIP\White et al. - 2019 - The link between reading ability and visual spatia.pdf,TRUE

So far, however, the underlying mechanisms are not understood. Specifically, it is unclear whether social norms can lead to a persistent perceptual bias. Using a diffusion model analysis, we extended the social reinforcement account (social norms work via mechanisms of reinforcement learning). Thereby, our study is the first to disentangle whether the effect of social norms on perceptual decision-making is due to altering the uptake of sensory information (i.e., a perceptual bias) or due to shifting the decision criteria (i.e., a judgmental bias). Across two experiments, our results consistently show that learning of social norms shapes perceptual decision-making due to a lasting perceptual bias towards norm-congruent sensory information. This finding was not moderated by the sociality of the norm, that is, by how strongly norms were linked to group membership. Complementary to current psychological models, our results suggest that social norms might become and remain internalized because individuals are chronically biased towards norm-congruent information.",2019-09-01,2020-02-06T01:48:47Z,2020-02-10T11:43:27Z,2020-02-06T01:48:47Z,103801,NA,84,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,Learning of social norms can lead to a persistent perceptual bias,NA,en,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\VRBPJIX4\Germar and Mojzisch - 2019 - Learning of social norms can lead to a persistent .pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\A4GWCF2F\S0022103118304347.html,NA,Social norms; Social influence; Diffusion model; Perceptual decision-making,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000535,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\VRBPJIX4\Germar and Mojzisch - 2019 - Learning of social norms can lead to a persistent .pdf,TRUE

We shed new light on heterogeneity in economic elites' political preferences, arguing that economic elites from an industry can share distinctive preferences due in part to sharing distinctive predispositions. Consequently, how increases in economic elites' influence affect inequality depends on which industry's elites are gaining influence and which policy issues are at stake. We demonstrate our argument with four original surveys, including the two largest political surveys of American economic elites to date: one of technology entrepreneurs—whose influence is burgeoning—and another of campaign donors. We show that technology entrepreneurs support liberal redistributive, social, and globalistic policies but conservative regulatory policies—a bundle of preferences rare among other economic elites.

The current research will provide deeper insight into the stigmatization and well-being of singles by understanding the ‘group-y’ nature of singles, and how identification with groups and perceptions of groups map onto discrimination and prejudice. Study 1 will examine the extent to which singles identify as part of a group. Participants will be assigned a novel minimal group identity and then complete measures of group identification for four distinct group memberships (e.g., minimal group, relationship status, sexual orientation, nationality). We hypothesize that single participants' identification with their single group will be lower compared to other identities—including partnered people—although a smaller subset of singles may identify strongly with other singles. We also hypothesize that singles in general will perceive less discrimination towards singles relative to other aspects of their identity. In contrast, Study 2 will examine the extent to which singles are perceived as a group and the extent to which they are perceived as being responsible for their group membership. Participants will complete measures of entitativity and perceptions of responsibility for similar out-group identities as in Study 1 (e.g., single people or people in romantic relationships, sexual or asexual people, etc.). We hypothesize that singles will be rated lower in entitativity than people in romantic relationships and other groups, yet rated higher in responsibility than other groups. Moreover, we hypothesize that prejudice towards singles will be more acceptable than prejudice towards other groups.

Two studies used less constrained, implicit (Experiment 1) and explicit categorization (Experiment 2) tasks and found that multiracial faces were most frequently categorized into racial minority groups but not necessarily as Black. These studies suggested a minority bias in multiracial categorizations, whereby multiracials are more frequently categorized as non-White than as White. Experiment 3 provided additional support for the minority bias, showing that participants categorized multiracials as “Not White” more often than as any other category.

Studies found robust NGA for new objects that resemble both positive and negative learned objects, and even stronger NGA for new objects that resemble neither. Two biases were suggested to underlie NGA: (1) negative response bias, whereby a novel object is perceived as novel, but forced to make a dichotomous good/bad decision, a responder has a strategy to classify it as bad; (2) negative weighting-of-similarity bias, whereby a novel object seems more similar to negative learned objects than to positive learned objects. We hypothesized that adding a third response alternative, “cannot be evaluated”, to the good/bad response alternatives commonly used in the BeanFest paradigm would reduce negative response bias but not negative weighting-of-similarity. As predicted, the new response alternative was used more as similarity to learned stimuli decreased. Also as predicted, NGA, although still significant, was lower in the 3-alternatives condition. Interestingly, extent of reduction in NGA due to adding the new response alternative did not vary as a function of stimulus type, and was not particularly strong for stimuli very dissimilar to any learned stimuli. These results confirm that NGA is indeed partly due to response bias. They additionally suggest that increased NGA with decreasing similarity to learned stimuli cannot be attributed solely to negative response bias. Thus, avoidance of new, unfamiliar objects does not reflect only strategic caution, but rather reflects to a large extent a naïve-realistic belief that they are negative.",2019-11-01,2020-02-06T01:59:56Z,2020-02-10T04:03:58Z,2020-02-06T01:59:56Z,103887,NA,85,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,NA,NA,en,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\KN2YEMV9\Ram and Liberman - 2019 - The relative contribution of response bias and wei.pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\NWC79Q8N\S0022103118300532.html,NA,Attitude generalization; Negative generalization asymmetry; Response bias; Weighting-of-similarity bias,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000544,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\KN2YEMV9\Ram and Liberman - 2019 - The relative contribution of response bias and wei.pdf,TRUE

Although most Americans indicate that they would prefer greater equality, redistributive policies aimed at reducing inequality are frequently unpopular. Traditional accounts posit that attitudes toward redistribution are driven by economic self-interest or ideological principles. From a social psychological perspective, however, we expected that subjective comparisons with other people may be a more relevant basis for self-interest than is material wealth. We hypothesized that participants would support redistribution more when they felt low than when they felt high in subjective status, even when actual resources and self-interest were held constant. Moreover, we predicted that people would legitimize these shifts in policy attitudes by appealing selectively to ideological principles concerning fairness. In four studies, we found correlational (Study 1) and experimental (Studies 2–4) evidence that subjective status motivates shifts in support for redistributive policies along with the ideological principles that justify them.",2015-01-01,2018-03-20T23:52:14Z,2018-03-20T23:52:33Z,2018-03-20T23:52:14Z,15-26,1,26,Psychol Sci,NA,NA,en,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\WBULAW9J\Brown-Iannuzzi et al. - 2015 - Subjective Status Shapes Political Preferences.pdf,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2015,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000547,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\WBULAW9J\Brown-Iannuzzi et al. - 2015 - Subjective Status Shapes Political Preferences.pdf,TRUE

Here, we tested whether remembered visual salience contributes to vivid recollection. In three experiments, participants studied emotionally negative and neutral images that varied in luminance and color saturation, and they reconstructed the visual salience of each image in a subsequent test. Results revealed, unexpectedly, that memories were recollected as less visually salient than they were encoded, demonstrating a novel memory-fading effect, whereas negative emotion increased subjective memory vividness and the precision with which visual features were encoded. Finally, memory vividness tracked both the precision and remembered salience (bias) of visual information.

Participants from the Netherlands and the United Kingdom played iterated Trust Games with trustworthy and untrustworthy members of both ingroups and outgroups. We show that the influence of group membership on trust decisions depended on the valence of the interactions with individual group members. When interacting with trustworthy partners, people displayed outgroup favouritism throughout the game, investing higher in outgroup members than ingroup members. However, for untrustworthy partners, initial outgroup favouritism disappeared, and ingroup and outgroup members were equally distrusted by the end of the game.

Our results are consistent with findings from the specific paradigm that we replicated in that no effects on comprehension were detected in analyses conducted over all sites.

Piaget suggested that children need to learn the physical rules that govern their environment before they can represent abstract concepts such as number and time. Thus, learning how objects move in space and time may underpin the development of related abstract representations (i.e., mathematics). To test this hypothesis, we captured objective measures of interceptive timing in 309 primary school children (5–11 years old), alongside scores for general motor skill and national standardized academic attainment. Bayesian estimation showed that interceptive timing (but not general motor capability) uniquely predicted mathematical ability even after we controlled for age, reading, and writing attainment.

However, most listeners solve this problem effortlessly. In the present experiment, we demonstrated that part of the solution lies in predicting upcoming speech sounds and that predictions are modulated by high-level expectations about the current sound. Participants heard isolated fricatives (e.g., “s,” “sh”) and predicted the upcoming vowel. Accuracy was above chance, which suggests that fine-grained detail in the signal can be used for prediction. A second group performed the same task but also saw a still face and a letter corresponding to the fricative. This group performed markedly better, which suggests that high-level knowledge modulates prediction by helping listeners form expectations about what the fricative should have sounded like. This suggests a form of data explanation operating in speech perception: Listeners account for variance due to their knowledge of the talker and current phoneme, and they use what is left over to make more accurate predictions about the next sound.",2016-01-01,2018-03-20T01:51:02Z,2018-03-20T01:51:10Z,2018-03-20T01:51:02Z,43-52,1,27,Psychol Sci,What Comes After /f/?,NA,en,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\IWL8MLGG\McMurray and Jongman - 2016 - What Comes After f Prediction in Speech Derives.pdf,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,2016,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000556,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\IWL8MLGG\McMurray and Jongman - 2016 - What Comes After f Prediction in Speech Derives.pdf,TRUE

Each protocol was administered to approximately half of 125 samples that comprised 15,305 participants from 36 countries and territories. Using the conventional criterion of statistical significance (p < .05), we found that 15 (54%) of the replications provided evidence of a statistically significant effect in the same direction as the original finding. With a strict significance criterion (p < .0001), 14 (50%) of the replications still provided such evidence, a reflection of the extremely high-powered design. Seven (25%) of the replications yielded effect sizes larger than the original ones, and 21 (75%) yielded effect sizes smaller than the original ones. The median comparable Cohen’s ds were 0.60 for the original findings and 0.15 for the replications. The effect sizes were small (< 0.20) in 16 of the replications (57%), and 9 effects (32%) were in the direction opposite the direction of the original effect. Across settings, the Q statistic indicated significant heterogeneity in 11 (39%) of the replication effects, and most of those were among the findings with the largest overall effect sizes; only 1 effect that was near zero in the aggregate showed significant heterogeneity according to this measure. Only 1 effect had a tau value greater than .20, an indication of moderate heterogeneity. Eight others had tau values near or slightly above .10, an indication of slight heterogeneity. Moderation tests indicated that very little heterogeneity was attributable to the order in which the tasks were performed or whether the tasks were administered in lab versus online. Exploratory comparisons revealed little heterogeneity between Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic (WEIRD) cultures and less WEIRD cultures (i.e., cultures with relatively high and low WEIRDness scores, respectively).

This effect was not due to negative evaluations shared by beardedness and anger or to negative stereotypes associated with beardedness, as beards did not facilitate recognition of another negative expression, sadness (Experiment 2, N = 90), and beards increased the rated prosociality of happy faces in addition to the rated masculinity and aggressiveness of angry faces (Experiment 3, N = 445).

One of the main candidate as the cortical source of this ERP component is the inferior intraparietal sulcus (IPS). Moreover, previous neuroimaging studies put forth evidence for the presence of a distributed VWM network involving also prefrontal areas and in particular the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Nonetheless, the understanding of the functional role of ACC is still debated. We recorded the high-density EEG in 20 healthy participants undergoing a VWM and a control task. Explorative cluster-based permutation statistics confirmed the posterior memory load dependent CDA modulation, but also identified an additional anterior cluster of electrodes whose amplitude was modulated by memory load. The source reconstruction revealed a memory load dependent activation in the IPS but also in the ACC, suggesting that these two areas might be nodes of a fronto-parietal circuit underlying VWM maintenance. Crucially, parietal and prefrontal areas showed a temporal dissociation, since IPS was more engaged in the early phase of visual information storage while the ACC was more active during the late phase. This pattern suggests a functional dissociation between the parietal cortex, which is involved in encoding and storage of information, and prefrontal areas, subserving cognitive control processes, including the boosting and protection of information from decay. Remarkably, the connection strength between IPS and ACC predicted the individual number of items held in memory.

In part, this is because product proliferation makes the introduction of close substitutes comparatively less profitable; in part, it is because the strategy conveys a threat of retaliation to potential imitators. Yet this threat is only credible if the proliferator has high costs of exit from the occupied region of space. We hypothesize that complexity, as a property of product (sub)spaces, generates exit costs for the proliferator and increases the deterrent power of its strategy. We test this hypothesis by studying sequential product introductions in the U.S. recording industry, 2004–2014. Managerial Summary Differentiated-product markets are often concentrated in the hands of a few dominant organizations, which strive to keep on equal footing by offering similar products. In these markets, a product proliferation strategy can help one of the dominant incumbents claim a particular submarket as its territory. Investing heavily in that submarket communicates a threat that the proliferator will retaliate against invaders to protect these investments. However, this threat is not credible enough to deter rivals unless the occupied submarket is sufficiently complex in terms of product attributes, as precisely this kind of complexity makes it harder for proliferators to back down if challenged. We find evidence of this mechanism in an analysis of product competition among major record companies and discuss implications for strategic decision-making.

We tested whether physical experience with angular momentum increases involvement of sensorimotor brain systems during students’ subsequent reasoning and whether this involvement aids their understanding. The physical experience, a brief exposure to forces associated with angular momentum, significantly improved quiz scores.

To address these issues, we monitored the happiness and social interactions of more than 30,000 people for a month. We found that patterns of social interaction followed the hedonic-flexibility principle, whereby people tend to engage in happiness-enhancing social relationships when they feel bad and sustain happiness-decreasing periods of solitude and less pleasant types of social relationships that might promise long-term payoff when they feel good.

I propose that individuals who care about contentious social issues signal to observers that they have integrity and thus can be trusted. Critically, this signal conveys trustworthiness whether or not the target and the observer hold the same view on the issue. Five studies (N = 3,817) demonstrated the predicted effect of caring on integrity-based trust (Studies 1, 2, 3a, 3b, and 4)—even in cases of strong disagreement—across a variety of issues (Study 1) and when behavioral outcomes with real stakes were used (Studies 3a and 3b).

This article challenges this idea for the case of teacher unions in the United States and argues that while collective bargaining institutions sometimes lead to increased education spending, this is not the norm. Using a new longitudinal data set spanning all states before and after they granted collective bargaining rights to teachers, the article shows that although states that mandate districts to bargain with teachers have higher education expenditures than states that do not, the differences precede collective bargaining. Difference-in-differences analyses find no evidence that introducing collective bargaining rights led to average increases in the level of resources devoted to education. Although existing theories cannot explain these null findings, the article shows one reason behind them is that most laws granting collective bargaining rights to teachers were not unambiguously prolabor, but included both pro- and anti-union provisions.",2019,2019-03-20T11:52:08Z,2019-03-20T11:53:53Z,2019-03-20T11:52:08Z,21-36,1,63,NA,NA,NA,en,"©2018, Midwest Political Science Association",Wiley Online Library,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\HUI8VLXU\Paglayan - 2019 - Public-Sector Unions and the Size of Government.pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\ZCQHHWXL\ajps.html,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000570,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\HUI8VLXU\Paglayan - 2019 - Public-Sector Unions and the Size of Government.pdf,TRUE

We argue that people make motivated judgments of outgroup entitativity based on their pre-existing attitudes toward the outgroup and the valence of outgroup members' actions. In both a first study and a pre-registered replication, we find that when people have positive attitudes toward Muslims, they judge Muslims to be lower in entitativity following a Muslim's negative action and higher in entitativity following a Muslim individuals' positive action, thus holding Muslims responsible for positive, but not negative individual actions.

Specifically, we argue that atheists (but not Christians) experience unique reputational concerns due to stereotypes that their group is immoral, which in turn affect their behavior toward outgroup partners. Across three studies, when participants in a Dictator Game believed their religious identity was known to their partner, atheists behaved impartially toward ingroup and outgroup partners, whereas Christians consistently demonstrated an ingroup bias.

Not only did context reinstatement increase correct recognition of old objects, but it also consistently increased incorrect recognition of similar objects as old ones. This false recognition effect was robust, as it was found in several experiments, occurred after both immediate and delayed testing, and persisted with high confidence even after participants were warned to avoid the distorting effects of context.

We hypothesised that unexpectedly appearing objects that contain a feature linked to high value, as established via reward learning in a previous task, would subsequently be detected more frequently than objects containing a feature linked to low value. A total of 537 participants first learned the association between a perceptual feature (colour) and subsequent reward values (high, low, or none reward). Afterwards, participants were randomly assigned to a static (Experiment 1) or dynamic (Experiment 2) inattentional blindness task including an unexpected object associated with high, low, or none reward.

Researchers have observed considerable covariation among these and other economic games, leading them to assert that there exists a general human propensity to cooperate that varies in strength across individuals and manifests itself across a variety of social settings. To formalize this hypothesis, we created an S-1 bifactor model using 276 participants' Dictator Game and Trust Game decisions. The general factor had significant, moderate associations with self-reported and peer-reported altruism, trust, and trustworthiness. Thus, the positive covariation among economic games is not reducible to the games' shared situational features. Two hundred participants returned for a second session. The general factor based on Dictator Game and Trust Game decisions from this session did not significantly predict self-reported and peer-reported cooperation, suggesting that experience with economic games causes them to measure different traits from those that are reflected in self-assessments and peer-assessments of cooperativeness. © 2018 European Association of Personality Psychology",2019,2019-03-20T17:56:32Z,2019-03-20T17:58:10Z,2019-03-20T17:56:32Z,89-103,1,33,NA,NA,NA,en,© 2018 European Association of Personality Psychology,Wiley Online Library,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\JPWAUV7U\McAuliffe e.a. - 2019 - Does Cooperation in the Laboratory Reflect the Ope.pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\545J47VP\per.html,NA,cooperation; Dictator Game; Trust Game; S-1 bifactor model; social heuristics hypothesis,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000580,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\JPWAUV7U\McAuliffe e.a. - 2019 - Does Cooperation in the Laboratory Reflect the Ope.pdf,TRUE

From the perspective of Social Identity Theory, a strong association between a person and the norm referent group is key to the effectiveness of descriptive social norms on behavior. The general aim of the studies presented in this paper was to examine the effects of descriptive social norm based messages on eating intentions and behaviors, and whether social identity moderates these effects. Study 1 and Study 2 examined whether the effect of a descriptive social norm message promoting vegetable intake (or limiting junk food intake) was moderated by the extent to which participants identified with the norm referent group. We found that centrality of social identification with the norm referent group moderated the effect of descriptive social norm messages on intentions to eat vegetables and intentions to limit junk food intake. Study 3 built on those findings by examining whether priming social identity enhanced the effects of a descriptive social norm message on actual food intake in a laboratory setting. We found that intake of fruit and vegetables was enhanced after exposure to a descriptive social norm message (versus a health message) but this effect was only significant for participants whose identification with the norm referent group had been primed. Taken together, these data add to the suggestion that acting in line with group norms is more likely when individuals regard their membership of the group as being important to their identity.",2019-05-01,2020-02-04T03:40:43Z,2020-02-04T03:41:00Z,2020-02-04T03:40:43Z,217-230,NA,82,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,NA,NA,en,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,"C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\VIHW9QD2\Liu et al. - 2019 - The relationship between social identity, descript.pdf", C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\CNSZSNKH\S0022103118304128.html,NA,Social identity; Eating behavior; Manipulation; Moderation; Social norm,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000581,"C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\VIHW9QD2\Liu et al. - 2019 - The relationship between social identity, descript.pdf",TRUE

The introduction and widespread acceptance of preprint archived reports and open-source software have made state-of-the-art statistical methods readily accessible to researchers. At the same time, researchers are increasingly concerned that their results should be reproducible (i.e., the same analysis should yield the same numeric results at a later time), which is a basic requirement for assessing the results’ replicability (i.e., whether results at a later time support the same conclusions). Although this age of fast-paced methodology greatly facilitates reproducibility and replicability, it also undermines them in ways not often realized by researchers. This article draws researchers’ attention to these threats and proposes guidelines to help minimize their impact. Reproducibility may be influenced by software development and change over time, a problem that is greatly compounded by the rising dependency between software packages.

However, there are competing views on whether financial incentives stimulate coproduction. While some argue that financial incentives increase citizens' willingness to coproduce, others suggest that incentives decrease their willingness (i.e., crowding out). To test these competing expectations, the authors designed a set of experiments that offered subjects a financial incentive to assist municipalities in helping refugees integrate. The experiment was first conducted among university students within a laboratory setting. Then, the initial findings were replicated and extended among a general adult sample. Results suggest that small financial rewards have no effect: they neither increase nor decrease people's willingness to coproduce. When the offered amount is increased substantially, willingness to coproduce increases only marginally. Hence, financial incentives are not a very cost-efficient instrument to stimulate coproduction.",2018-11-01,2019-04-08T11:52:44Z,2019-04-08T11:54:45Z,2019-04-08T11:52:44Z,864-873,6,78,Public Administration Review,Financial Rewards Do Not Stimulate Coproduction,NA,NA,NA,onlinelibrary.wiley.com (Atypon),NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\NGRNHA9Q\Voorberg et al. - 2018 - Financial Rewards Do Not Stimulate Coproduction E.pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\VATZZ4NF\puar.html,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2018,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000588,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\NGRNHA9Q\Voorberg et al. - 2018 - Financial Rewards Do Not Stimulate Coproduction E.pdf,TRUE

In Study 1, cross-national analyses show that parties behave more programmatically under compulsory voting and that vote buying is less common where voting is mandatory. In Study 2, synthetic control and difference-in-differences analyses show that a switch to compulsory voting in Thailand produced an increase in programmatic vote seeking.

Standardized protocols in data collection, analysis, and interpretation are foundations of empiricism and a healthy sign of a discipline’s maturity. I propose that meta-analysis as typically applied in psychology will benefit from complementing aggregation of observed effect sizes with systematic examination of the standardization of the methodology that deterministically produced them.

Specifically, we present four studies demonstrating that facial width-to-height ratio, a stable feature of all faces, biases pain judgments. Compared to those with low facial width-to-height ratio, individuals with high facial width-to-height ratio are perceived as experiencing less pain in otherwise identical situations (Studies 1, 2, & 3), and as needing less pain medication to salve their injuries (Study 4). This process was observed for White but not Black targets (Study 2), and manipulations of facial width-to-height ratio affected pain perceptions even when target identity was held constant (Study 4).

While many scholars focus on candidates’ racial/ethnic attributes, ethnic group endorsements are understudied. Whether such endorsements induce voters to choose ideologically similar candidates (spatial voting), or choose based on race/ethnicity (racial voting) is unclear. We address this question by examining elections in multiethnic local settings. Using original surveys and exit polls, we create comparable measures of candidate and voter ideology, and examine how race/ethnicity and ideology affect voters’ choices. We also embed experiments that manipulate ethnic group endorsements. We find that ideology influences voters’ choices, but that ethnic group endorsements weaken spatial voting. The latter effect among whites is driven by racial/ethnic stereotypes.

However, a linkage between positive prediction errors—the difference between expected and obtained outcomes—and consequent risk taking has yet to be demonstrated. Using a large data set of New York City lottery gambling and a model inspired by computational accounts of reward learning, we found that people gamble more when incidental outcomes in the environment (e.g., local sporting events and sunshine) are better than expected. When local sports teams performed better than expected, or a sunny day followed a streak of cloudy days, residents gambled more. The observed relationship between prediction errors and gambling was ubiquitous across the city’s socioeconomically diverse neighborhoods and was specific to sports and weather events occurring locally in New York City.

Following this initial success, the present study compares, in a preregistered analysis, hiring rates of new female faculty pre- and post-manipulation.

Yet, the bulk of this research has not considered how racial stereotypes might also depend on other aspects of targets' identities. To address this, researchers have begun to ask intersectional questions about racial stereotypes, such as whether they are applied in similar ways to men and women, or to children and adults. In the present studies, we examine whether men who are described as gay (vs. not) become de-racialized in the minds of perceivers. That is, we test whether gay (vs. non-gay) men are perceived as less stereotypic of their own racial or ethnic groups. Results consistently support the de-racialization hypothesis, regardless of whether targets are Black, White, Asian, or Hispanic. Moreover, when Black and Hispanic men are described as gay (vs. not), they become stereotypically “Whitened” in addition to seeming less stereotypic of their own racial groups. This “Whitening” effect is explained by Black and Hispanic men's seeming more affluent when described as gay (vs. when not), an effect that holds even when controlling for changes in these men's stereotypic femininity. Collectively, these findings underscore the point that race and sexual orientation are not orthogonal in the minds of perceivers. A minority sexual orientation can alter the racial characteristics ascribed to men, reducing the perceived presence of race-typical traits and, for low-SES men, increasing their perceived “Whiteness.”",2019-07-01,2020-02-06T01:35:37Z,2020-02-10T11:49:50Z,2020-02-06T01:35:37Z,37-54,NA,83,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,Racial stereotyping of gay men,NA,en,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\RDLEIJIP\Petsko and Bodenhausen - 2019 - Racial stereotyping of gay men Can a minority sex.pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\NC9USBXA\S0022103118304876.html,NA,Group prototypes; Intersectional stereotypes; Racial bias; Sexual orientation,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000614,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\RDLEIJIP\Petsko and Bodenhausen - 2019 - Racial stereotyping of gay men Can a minority sex.pdf,TRUE

Using a dual-estimation report (N = 42), we quantitatively assessed the processing of features alone and in conjunction with another feature both within and between dimensions. Under crowding, observers misreported colors and orientations (i.e., reported a flanker value instead of the target’s value) but averaged the target’s and flankers’ spatial frequencies (SFs). Interestingly, whereas orientation and color errors were independent, orientation and SF errors were interdependent. These qualitative differences of errors across dimensions revealed a tight link between crowding and feature binding, which is contingent on the type of feature dimension.

(PPBS) is a class of meaningless statements designed to appear profound. Profundity ratings for PPBS have been found to be negatively related to analytical thinking and positively related to epistemically suspect beliefs (e.g. belief in the paranormal). Conceptually similar traits within the Openness/Intellect (O/I) domain form a simplex, whereby traits are arranged along a single dimension from intelligence to apophenia (i.e. observing patterns or causal connections were none exist). Across two studies (total N = 297), we attempted to replicate the O/I simplex and determine how it relates to perceiving PPBS as profound. Participants completed questionnaires measuring traits from the O/I simplex and provided profundity ratings for PPBS. Profundity ratings of PPBS tended to correlate negatively with intelligence and positively with apophenia. The association with intelligence generally reflected a greater ability to discriminate the profound from the pseudo-profound, whereas the association with apophenia reflected poorer discrimination in Study 1, with less conclusive results in Study 2. In both studies, the O/I simplex was closely replicated. The results suggest a link between the O/I domain and perceiving PPBS as profound and tentatively support the theory that intelligence may protect against apophenia. ? 2018 European Association of Personality Psychology",2019-01-01,2019-03-20T17:56:12Z,2019-03-20T18:00:05Z,2019-03-20T17:56:12Z,72-88,1,33,European Journal of Personality,Openness/Intellect and Susceptibility to Pseudo-Profound Bullshit,NA,NA,NA,onlinelibrary.wiley.com (Atypon),NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\43UTB8T4\Bainbridge e.a. - 2019 - OpennessIntellect and Susceptibility to Pseudo-Pr.pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\NEMF6JWJ\per.html,NA,apophenia; Openness/Intellect; pseudo-profound bullshit; simplex,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,a000620,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\43UTB8T4\Bainbridge e.a. - 2019 - OpennessIntellect and Susceptibility to Pseudo-Pr.pdf,TRUE

However, work making this comparison has reported no difference between these two types of priming. Importantly, the reported non-differences have been found in the visual domain. Here, we investigate morphological (Morph) versus repetition (Rep) priming in two auditory primed lexical decision experiments. Using the English plural suffix -/z/, we compare Rep priming with Morph priming for both singular and plural target conditions (e.g., frog/frogs → frog, frog/frogs → frogs). Overall, we find robust priming in both Rep and Morph conditions. However, for both singular and plural targets, there is consistent evidence that Rep priming is greater than Morph priming at early lags of 0 and 1 intervening items. This facilitation decreases with an increasing number of intervening items. Comparisons with phonological and semantic controls demonstrate that this pattern cannot be attributed solely to shared form or meaning. We interpret these findings in a decompositional model of morphological processing.

Here, we focus on the role of ambiguity in shaping people’s ethical blind spots, which in turn lead to their ethical failures. We suggest that in ambiguous settings, individuals’ attention shifts toward tempting information, which determines the magnitude of their lies. Employing a novel ambiguous-dice paradigm, we asked participants to report the outcome of the die roll appearing closest to the location of a previously presented fixation cross on a computer screen; this outcome would determine their pay. We varied the value of the die second closest to the fixation cross to be either higher (i.e., tempting) or lower (i.e., not tempting) than the die closest to the fixation cross. Results of two experiments revealed that in ambiguous settings, people’s incorrect responses were self-serving.

Whereas children have been shown to be averse to gender nonconformity in peers, because many transgender children appear and behave in ways consistent with their expressed gender (but not their sex at birth), it is unclear how children evaluate these identities. In 2 studies, we investigated 5- to 10year-old children’s (Ntotal = 113) preferences for transgender versus gender-“typical” peers who either shared their gender identity or did not. We also examined whether children categorized transgender peers by their sex or expressed gender, as it might inform their evaluations. Children preferred cisgender peers over transgender peers; however, they also liked peers of their own gender rather than the other gender (e.g., female participants preferred girls over boys), demonstrating that the oft-documented own-gender bias plays an important role even when children are reasoning about transgender peers. Children did not reliably categorize transgender peers by sex or gender; yet those who categorized transgender peers by their sex showed greater dislike of transgender peers. The current studies are the ﬁrst to investigate cisgender children’s attitudes toward transgender children and suggest that perceptions of gender categorization and conformity play a role in children’s evaluations of transgender peers.",2018-08-08,2019-04-09T09:23:56Z,2019-04-09T09:24:06Z,2019-04-09T09:23:56Z,325-344,4,19,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,DOI.org (Crossref),NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\TC3KF52G\Gülgöz e.a. - 2018 - Children’s Evaluation and Categorization of Transg.pdf,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2018,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000631,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\TC3KF52G\Gülgöz e.a. - 2018 - Children’s Evaluation and Categorization of Transg.pdf,TRUE

I argue that these explanations require a longer time horizon than the empirical evidence permits. Education, for example, typically ends in young adulthood and so cannot logically mediate the effect of income on participation in late adulthood. To resolve this temporal problem, I propose that there are two income-participation gaps: one based on current economic status and another on childhood economic history. I situate this argument in a developmental framework and present evidence for it using six studies. The results, while mixed at times, indicate that there are two gaps, that the size of each gap changes over the life course, and that their joint effect creates a larger income-participation gap than estimated by prior research.",2018,2019-03-20T11:40:00Z,2019-03-20T11:40:14Z,2019-03-20T11:40:00Z,813-829,4,62,NA,NA,NA,en,"©2018, Midwest Political Science Association",Wiley Online Library,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\5CLHMB86\Ojeda - 2018 - The Two Income-Participation Gaps.pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\LSDYYFQR\ajps.html,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2018,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000635,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\5CLHMB86\Ojeda - 2018 - The Two Income-Participation Gaps.pdf,TRUE

Our analyses revealed a small, significant, negative relationship between intelligence and total psychopathy (r = −.07, p = .001). Analysis of factors and facets found differential associations, including both significant positive (e.g. interpersonal facet) and negative (e.g. affective facet) associations, further affirming that psychopathy is a multidimensional construct. Additionally, intelligence was negatively associated with antisocial personality disorder (r = −.13, p = .001) and conduct disorder (r = −.13, p = .001) but positively with oppositional defiant disorder (r = .06, p = .001).

In addition, the older adults chose the more risky option more often than the younger adults in the gain and mixed domains; this difference in risk aversion was attributable to less pronounced negative affect among the older adults. Computational modeling with a hierarchical Bayesian implementation of cumulative prospect theory revealed that the older adults had higher response noise and more optimistic decision weights for gains than did the younger adults.

What mechanism supports such inferences? We propose that statistical learning is a process through which transitive inferences of new associations are made between objects that have never been directly associated. After viewing a continuous sequence containing two base pairs (e.g., A–B, B–C), participants automatically inferred a transitive pair (e.g., A–C) where the two objects had never co-occurred before (Experiment 1). This transitive inference occurred in the absence of explicit awareness of the base pairs. However, participants failed to infer the transitive pair from three base pairs (Experiment 2), showing the limits of the transitive inference (Experiment 3). We further demonstrated that this transitive inference can operate across the categorical hierarchy (Experiments 4–7).

We find that the intensity of expressed anger profoundly influences social perceptions and status conferral. Compared to mildly or moderately angry individuals, extremely angry people are perceived to be less competent and warm, and are thus accorded less status. We also contrast expressions of anger with expressions of sadness across different levels of intensity. At low levels of intensity anger expressions boost status conferral compared to sadness expressions and a neutral control condition, but at high levels of intensity anger expressions harm status conferral compared to sadness expressions and a neutral control condition.

Yet both children and adults successfully learn noun meanings at the intended level of abstraction from similar evidence. Xu and Tenenbaum (2007a) provided an explanation for this apparent puzzle: Learners assume that examples are sampled from the true underlying category (strong sampling), making cases in which there are more observed exemplars more consistent with a subordinate meaning than cases in which there are fewer exemplars (the suspicious-coincidence effect). Authors of more recent work (Spencer, Perone, Smith, & Samuelson, 2011) have questioned the relevance of this finding, however, arguing that the effect occurs only when the examples are presented to the learner simultaneously. Across a series of 12 experiments (N = 600), we systematically manipulated several experimental parameters that varied across previous studies, and we successfully replicated the findings of both sets of authors.

Two accounts have been proposed to explain this relationship, one of which emphasizes proximally avoiding outgroups, and the other of which emphasizes adherence to traditional norms. According to the former, immigrants are perceived as being more infectious because they carry novel pathogens due to their foreign ecological origins. According to the latter, immigrants' foreign norms are perceived as posing a pathogen threat. This study aimed to disentangle these accounts. Participants (N = 975) were randomly assigned to read a description of an immigrant who had high or low contact with locals and high or low assimilation to local norms. The effect of disgust sensitivity on sentiments toward the immigrant (and immigrants like him) was compared across conditions. Results supported the traditional norms account: disgust sensitivity related to anti-immigrant sentiments when the immigrant was described as not assimilating to local norms, but not when he was described as assimilating. Contrary to the outgroup avoidance account, the relationship between disgust sensitivity and anti-immigrant sentiments did not vary across the high-contact and low-contact conditions. Results suggest that resistance to foreign norms, rather than avoidance of novel pathogens, better explains the relationship between pathogen avoidance and outgroup prejudice.",2019-09-01,2020-02-06T01:43:44Z,2020-02-10T11:48:06Z,2020-02-06T01:43:44Z,103817,NA,84,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,Disgust sensitivity and opposition to immigration,NA,en,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\JSTR8KAH\Karinen et al. - 2019 - Disgust sensitivity and opposition to immigration.pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\4693FE6N\S0022103118304220.html,NA,Outgroup avoidance; The behavioral immune system; Disgust sensitivity; Immigration,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000650,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\JSTR8KAH\Karinen et al. - 2019 - Disgust sensitivity and opposition to immigration.pdf,TRUE

So far, the mechanisms underlying framing effects on patience have been elusive. We investigated the role of imagination in these effects. In a behavioral experiment (Experiment 1), a classic framing manipulation (sequence framing) increased self-reported and independently coded imagination during intertemporal choice. In an investigation of neural responses during decision making (Experiment 2), sequence framing increased the extent to which patience was related to activation in brain regions associated with imagination, relative to activation in regions associated with willpower, and increased functional connectivity of brain regions associated with imagination, but not willpower, relative to regions associated with valuation.

One option is to directly target others' behavior through rules and incentives. Another increasingly popular option, however, is to focus on modifying what others think rather than how they behave, and hoping behaviors will then change as a result. The assumption underlying this latter approach is that targeting thoughts and attitudes might be easier or more effective than targeting behaviors. Drawing from psychological reactance theory (Brehm, 1966), we investigate whether efforts targeted at controlling what people think, rather than how they behave, will indeed be met with differing levels of psychological reactance. Across four studies, we find that people experience greater psychological reactance towards efforts to control their thoughts compared to efforts to control their behaviors. Specifically, thought control, compared to behavioral control, led people to experience greater anger and negativity, and to report lowered motivation to engage in requested behaviors (Study 1). These effects occurred, at least in part, because people perceived that those who try to control their thoughts are likely to try to control their behaviors too, but not vice versa. As a result, thought control elicited greater reactance than behavioral control because the former was perceived as more restrictive than the latter (Studies 2 & 3). We also address other explanations for why thought control may elicit more reactance than behavioral control (Study 4).",2019-09-01,2020-02-06T01:46:13Z,2020-02-10T11:45:08Z,2020-02-06T01:46:13Z,103825,NA,84,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,NA,NA,en,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\IGNK2P28\Ma et al. - 2019 - Psychological reactance as a function of thought v.pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\ILF5U8PQ\S0022103118307121.html,NA,Behavioral control; Psychological reactance; Thought control,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000664,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\IGNK2P28\Ma et al. - 2019 - Psychological reactance as a function of thought v.pdf,TRUE

A common explanation is that third-party punishment exists to maintain a cooperative society. We tested a different explanation: Third-party punishment results from a deterrence psychology for defending personal interests. Because humans evolved in small-scale, face-to-face social worlds, the mind infers that mistreatment of a third party predicts later mistreatment of oneself. We showed that when punishers do not have information about how they personally will be treated, they infer that mistreatment of other people predicts mistreatment of themselves, and these inferences predict punishment. But when information about personal mistreatment is available, it drives punishment.

U.S. and UK citizens who believed that the kind of person someone is can be changed were more likely to support resettling refugees in their country (Studies 1 and 2). Study 3 identified a causal relationship between the type of mind-set people hold and their support for resettling refugees. Importantly, people with a growth mind-set were more likely to believe that refugees can assimilate in the host society but not that they should assimilate, and the belief that refugees can assimilate mediated the relationship between people’s mind-sets and their support for resettling refugees (Studies 4–6). The findings identify an important antecedent of people’s support for resettling refugees and provide novel insights into the science of mind-sets.",2019-02,2019-04-06T18:51:57Z,2019-04-06T18:52:10Z,2019-04-06T18:51:57Z,238-249,2,30,NA,Support for Resettling Refugees,NA,en,NA,Crossref,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\X6T7QCS3\Madan e.a. - 2019 - Support for Resettling Refugees The Role of Fixed.pdf,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,a000670,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\X6T7QCS3\Madan e.a. - 2019 - Support for Resettling Refugees The Role of Fixed.pdf,TRUE

A combination of Bayes analyses and standard regressions revealed that the age at which the children had the conceptual insight that number words represent specific quantities (cardinal value) was strongly related to their later number-system knowledge and was more consistently related to broader mathematics than to reading achievement, controlling for intelligence, executive function, and parental education levels.

Evidence suggests that this effect is attributable to persuasion rather than differential mobilization. The effectiveness of biased media varied in a politically consequential way: Its impact was largest on voters with strong pro-Russian priors but was less effective, and to some degree even counter-effective, in persuading those with strong pro-Western priors.

Immediately before rating, 20 listeners heard critical comments about Quebec French speakers’ English language skills, while 20 heard positive comments. Twenty listeners (baseline group) received no manipulation. Compared to baseline listeners, positively oriented listeners (younger and older) rated four of five dimensions more favorably. However, listeners’ behavior diverged under negative bias. Compared to age-matched baseline listeners, younger listeners upgraded speakers while older listeners downgraded speakers for all targeted measures.

We argue that elite polarization as signaled by radical parties' first entrance into parliament leads to voter divergence. Immediately after the election, legitimization and backlash effects mean that voters on both ideological sides move toward the extremes. In the longer term, this polarization is solidified because of radical parties' parliamentary presence. A panel study of Dutch voters shows that the 2002 parliamentary entrance of a radical-right party indeed led to immediate ideological polarization across the political spectrum. Estimating time-series cross-sectional models on Eurobarometer data from 17 countries (1973–2016) shows an additional long-term impact of radical-right party entry on polarization.

This has been classically interpreted as related to a self-other distinction, with impaired visual representations of other bodies seen in third person perspective (3PP), besides spared own body somatosensory representations in 1PP. However, HwA could be impacted by a deficit in the integration of visual and somatosensory information in space, that are spatially congruent in the case of one's own body, but not for others' body. Here, we test this hypothesis in a rare neurological patient with HwA, H+, as well as in a control patient with a comparable neuropsychological profile, but without HwA, and in age-matched healthy controls, in two experiments. First, we assessed body part recognition in a new task where somatosensory information from the participant's body and visual information from the target body shown in virtual reality was never aligned in space. Results show that, differently from the flawless performance in controls, H+ committed errors for not only the body of others in 3PP, but for all conditions where the information related to the real and the target body was not spatially congruent. Then, we tested whether the integration between these multisensory bodily cues in space, as during visuo-tactile stimulation in the full-body illusion, improves the patient's performance. Data show that after the stimulation prompting visuo-tactile integration, but not in control conditions, the patient's abilities to process body parts improved up to normal level, thus confirming and extending the first findings. Altogether, these results support a new interpretation of HwA as linked to the matching between somatosensory inputs from one's body and visual information from a body seen at a distance, and encourage the application of multisensory stimulation and virtual reality for the treatment of body-related disorders.",2019-11-01,2020-01-30T07:52:45Z,2020-01-30T11:10:25Z,2020-01-30T07:52:45Z,212-222,NA,120,Cortex,You or me?,NA,en,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,"C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\TVUL4CFH\Bassolino et al. - 2019 - You or me Disentangling perspectival, perceptual,.pdf", C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\TVPR3H3S\S001094521930228X.html,NA,Body recognition; Body-related disorders; Heterotopagnosia; Self-other distinction; Stroke; Virtual reality,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000687,"C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\TVUL4CFH\Bassolino et al. - 2019 - You or me Disentangling perspectival, perceptual,.pdf",TRUE

Teacher characteristics predicted close to 20% of variance in FLE but only 8% of variance in FLCA. The strongest positive predictor of FLE was a teacher's friendliness while a teacher's foreign accent was a weaker negative predictor. Teacher-centered variables predicted much less variance for FLCA.

In line with this proposition, the effective-altruism movement seeks to provide individuals with information regarding the effectiveness of charities in hopes that they will contribute to organizations that maximize the social return of their donation. In this research, we investigated the extent to which presenting effectiveness information leads people to choose more effective charities. We found that even when effectiveness information is made easily comparable across options, it has a limited impact on choice. Specifically, people frequently choose less effective charity options when those options represent more subjectively preferred causes. In contrast to making a personal donation decision, outcome metrics are used to a much greater extent when choosing financial investments and when allocating aid resources as an agent of an organization.

In Study 1, participants reported greater perceived cultural malleability in response to images of child Syrian refugees (compared to those of adults with explicit markers of ethnic/religious identity, or groups of refugees), which positively predicted policy support.

The data rescue protocols here address this gap, covering the information lifecycle from handwritten register pages to transcription-ready content, describing the historical data, the database design for the data rescue, and the development of an application design to transcribe the meteorological information directly from an image file to the database. The preparatory steps necessary to organize, curate, image, and structure the meteorological information, prior to transcribing the historical data, are outlined here in an integrated methodology. The initial organization, the development of an image file nomenclature to link the rescued data to the original source, and the description of a metadata schema to optimize the transcription application are all vital to the process of ensuring traceability and transparency in the data rescue process. Taken together, these steps describe best practices guidelines for similar projects. Although we designed the methodology and application to be used in any data rescue context, our particular concern was to accommodate the needs of citizen scientists. We thus focused on making our application easily maintained, flexible, direct to database, clear, and simple to use.

In five studies (total N = 1,517), we found that when eye gaze was directed forward, tilting one’s head downward (compared with a neutral angle) increased perceptions of dominance, and this effect was due to the illusory appearance of lowered and V-shaped eyebrows caused by a downward head tilt. Tilting one’s head downward therefore functions as an action-unit imposter, creating the artificial appearance of a facial action unit that has a strong effect on social perception.

This so-called vigilance decrement has been attributed to depletion of attentional resources, though other factors such as reductions in motivation likely also play a role. In this study, we examined three electroencephalography (EEG) markers of attentional control, to elucidate which stage of attentional processing is most affected by time-on-task and motivation. To elicit the vigilance decrement, participants performed a sustained attention task for 80 min without breaks. After 60 min, participants were motivated by an unexpected monetary incentive to increase performance in the final 20 min. We found that task performance and self-reported motivation declined rapidly, reaching stable levels well before the motivation manipulation was introduced. Thereafter, motivation increased back up to the initial level, and remained there for the final 20 min. While task performance also increased, it did not return to the initial level, and fell to the lowest level overall during the final 10 min. This pattern of performance changes was mirrored by the trial-to-trial consistency of the phase of theta (3–7 Hz) oscillations, an index of the variability in timing of the neural response to the stimulus. As task performance decreased, temporal variability increased, suggesting that attentional stability is crucial for sustained attention performance. The effects of attention on our two other EEG measures—early P1/N1 event-related potentials (ERPs) and pre-stimulus alpha (9–14 Hz) power—did not change with time-on-task or motivation. In sum, these findings show that the vigilance decrement is accompanied by a decline in only some facets of attentional control, which cannot be fully brought back online by increases in motivation. The vigilance decrement might thus not occur due to a single cause, but is likely multifactorial in origin.",2019-08-01,2020-01-30T07:13:40Z,2020-01-30T07:14:12Z,2020-01-30T07:13:39Z,16-32,NA,117,Cortex,NA,NA,en,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\HUWEJVHX\Reteig et al. - 2019 - Sustaining attention for a prolonged period of tim.pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\C4TH8RSW\S0010945219300681.html,NA,Motivation; Vigilance; EEG; Sustained attention; Time-on-task,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000713,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\HUWEJVHX\Reteig et al. - 2019 - Sustaining attention for a prolonged period of tim.pdf,TRUE

Increasingly, there has been a focus on the specific situations in which particular personality traits predict prosocial behaviour. HEXACO Honesty-Humility—the basic trait most consistently linked to prosocial behaviour in prior studies—has been found to predict prosociality most strongly in situations that afford the exploitation of others. Importantly, though, it may be the subjectively perceived situation that affords the behavioural expression of a trait. Following this reasoning, we tested the proposition that Honesty-Humility would predict prosocial behaviour more strongly in situations characterised by, and perceived to contain, two dimensions of interdependence that can afford exploitation: high conflict and high power. However, across a series of incentivised economic games and two large experience sampling studies, we only found inconsistent evidence for the association between Honesty-Humility and prosocial behaviour. Furthermore, the link between Honesty-Humility and prosociality was neither conditional on objective interdependence nor on subjective perceptions of interdependence. Nonetheless, perceptions of conflict and power tracked objective properties of economic games and were related to prosocial behaviour in the lab and field. Future research should take individuals' subjective understanding of situations into account, which may also help understand the (generalisability of the) effect of Honesty-Humility on prosocial behaviour. © 2019 The Authors.

However, even in paradigms with zero risk of sanctions, individuals do not consistently cheat. Still more strikingly, most of the few findings available from studies implementing a sanctioning system run contrary to what would be expected based on utility-based accounts of dishonesty, showing increased cheating when there is a small risk of sanctions as compared to when the risk is zero. Given the striking nature of these findings and the general scarcity of corresponding evidence, we devised a targeted empirical test of the role of sanctions for dishonest behavior. Specifically, in two experiments, we manipulated the probability (i.e., 16.7% vs. 50%) that the factual truth of one's response in a cheating paradigm is checked.

We meta-analyzed three categories of quasiexperimental studies of educational effects on intelligence: those estimating education-intelligence associations after controlling for earlier intelligence, those using compulsory schooling policy changes as instrumental variables, and those using regression-discontinuity designs on school-entry age cutoffs. Across 142 effect sizes from 42 data sets involving over 600,000 participants, we found consistent evidence for beneficial effects of education on cognitive abilities of approximately 1 to 5 IQ points for an additional year of education.

As described and instructed, this strategy apparently relies on a spatial/navigational metaphor. The user imagines moving through an environment, placing (study) and reporting (recall) list items along the way. However, whether the method relies critically on this spatial/navigation metaphor is unknown. An alternative hypothesis is that the navigation component is superfluous to memory success, and the method of loci is better viewed as a special case of a larger class of imagery-based peg strategies. Training participants on three virtual environments varying in their characteristics (an apartment, an open field, and a radial-arm maze), we asked participants to use each trained environment as the basis of the method of loci to learn five 11-word lists. Performance varied significantly across environment. However, the effects were small in magnitude. Further tests suggested that navigation-relevant knowledge and ability were not major determinants of success in verbal memory, even for participants who were confirmed to have been compliant with the strategy. These findings echo neuroimaging findings that navigation-based cognition does occur during application of the method of loci, but imagined navigation is unlikely to be directly responsible for its effectiveness.

However, results from elections that took place in Europe during the Great Recession and scholarly research on economic voting in these elections cast serious doubts on the causal mechanism. This article directly tests this mechanism with a survey experiment using data from Greece (the country most affected by the debt crisis). The results suggest that although the economic vote is strong and substantive, its size does not vary across the room to maneuver treatments.

In this article, we show that when scarcity does influence cognition, it renders people less susceptible to classic context effects.

We combine behavioural probes with structural and functional brain imaging to provide the first comprehensive analysis of ToM deficits following stroke using the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET). First, fMRI was used to identify the functional brain network involved in a non-clinical cohort. Results indicated that, relative to a control task, the RMET increased activity in a widespread functional bilateral network comprising frontal and temporo-parietal areas. To investigate how damage to grey and white matter components of this network can lead to ToM impairment, parcel-based lesion-symptom mapping (PLSM), white-matter tract-wise statistical analysis (TSA) and disconnectome symptom mapping (DSM) were performed using structural images from 64 stroke patients. PLSM results revealed that low scores on the RMET were associated with damage centered around the right posterior frontal gyrus and insula. TSA and DSM results further revealed that low RMET scores were associated with damage to white-matter tracts connecting frontal and temporo-parietal components of the RMET functional network. Together, these findings suggest that making judgements about the mental states of others imposes demands on a large functional network that can easily be disrupted, both by damage to grey matter areas that form part of the network directly, or the white-matter pathways that connect them.",2019-12-01,2020-01-30T08:07:49Z,2020-01-30T11:29:32Z,2020-01-30T08:07:49Z,427-442,NA,121,Cortex,NA,NA,en,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\YT8Q8FRI\Domínguez D et al. - 2019 - Structural and functional brain correlates of theo.pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\3F3KW3GG\S0010945219303399.html,NA,Social cognition; Theory of mind; Stroke; Lesion symptom mapping; Reading the mind in the eyes; Social neuroscience,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000746,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\YT8Q8FRI\Domínguez D et al. - 2019 - Structural and functional brain correlates of theo.pdf,TRUE

Stereotype confirmation suggests that observers use stereotypes as hypotheses and interpret relevant evidence in a biased way that confirms their stereotypes. Shifting standards suggest that the evaluative standard to which we hold a target changes as a function of their group membership. We examined whether stereotype confirmation and shifting standards effects would be seen in college football coaches during recruiting. College football coaches evaluated a Black or White player on several attributes and made both zero- and non-zero-sum allocations. Results suggested that coaches used the evidence presented to develop biased subjective evaluations of the players based on race while still maintaining equivalent objective evaluations. Coaches also allocated greater overall resources to the Black recruit than the White recruit.,2015-05-04,2018-04-05T06:03:17Z,2018-04-05T06:03:45Z,2018-04-05T06:03:17Z,238-254,3,155,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Taylor and Francis+NEJM,PMID: 25559706,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\A7R5XNKR\Thomas et al. - 2015 - Racial Athletic Stereotype Confirmation in College.pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\3KKF655G\00224545.2014.html,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2015,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000747,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\A7R5XNKR\Thomas et al. - 2015 - Racial Athletic Stereotype Confirmation in College.pdf,TRUE

In a series of experiments, we found that 14-month-olds could rapidly learn a label for the role played by the chaser in a chasing scenario, even when the different instances of chasers did not share perceptual features. Furthermore, when infants could choose, they preferred to interpret a novel label as expressing the agent’s role within the observed interaction rather than as being associated with the agent’s appearance. These results demonstrate that infants can learn labels as easily (or even more easily) for concepts identified by abstract behavioral characteristics as for objects identified by perceptual features.

Can third party intervention redirect competitive interactions toward collectively beneficial cooperation? Does mutual cooperation persist when the third party can no longer intervene in the conflict? To address these theoretically and practically important questions, we introduce the Repeated Peacemaker Game. Adversaries and third parties interacted for 60 game rounds in our incentivized experiment, producing a rich dataset of 7200 decisions. Participants made decisions under one of two conditions: In the Early Intervention condition, third party intervention was initially possible and then became impossible. In the Late Intervention condition, third party intervention was initially impossible and then became possible. Third parties in the Early Intervention condition intervened at high rates and established cooperative norms that outlasted the intervention period, resulting in sustainable cooperation even after intervention was no longer possible. By comparison, third parties in the Late Intervention condition intervened at relatively lower rates, but still effectively promoted cooperation, despite the initial history of competition between adversaries. We find strong evidence for ‘conditional cooperation’, whereby adversaries and third parties reciprocate each other's choices in preceding rounds: Adversaries were more likely to cooperate when third parties intervened in the preceding round; third parties, in turn, were more likely to intervene when one or both adversaries cooperated in the preceding round than if both adversaries competed in the preceding round.

Activation in modality-specific regions of cortex is associated with the comprehension of literal language that describes the analogous modalities, but studies addressing the grounding of non-literal or figurative language, such as metaphors, have yielded mixed results. Differences in the psycholinguistic characteristics of sentence stimuli across studies have likely contributed to this lack of consensus. Furthermore, previous studies have been largely correlational, whilst patient studies are a critical way of determining if intact sensorimotor function is necessary to understand language drawing on sensorimotor information. We designed a battery of metaphorical and literal sentence stimuli using action and sound words, with an unprecedented level of control over critical psycholinguistic variables, to test hypotheses about the grounding of metaphorical language. In this Registered Report, we assessed the comprehension of these sentences in 41 patients with Parkinson's disease, who were predicted to be disproportionately affected by the action sentences relative to the sound sentences, and compared their performance to that of 39 healthy age-matched controls who were predicted to show no difference in performance due to sensory modality. Using preregistered Bayesian model comparison methods, we found that PD patients' comprehension of literal action sentences was not impaired, while there was some evidence for a slowing of responses to action metaphors. Follow up exploratory analyses suggest that this response time modality effect was driven by one type of metaphor (predicate) and was absent in another (nominal), despite the fact that the action semantics were similar in both syntactic forms. These results suggest that the conditions under which PD patients demonstrate hypothesized embodiment effects are limited. We offer a critical assessment of the PD action language literature and discuss implications for the embodiment debate. In addition, we suggest how future studies could leverage Bayesian statistical methods to provide more convincing evidence for or against embodied cognition effects.",2019-12-01,2020-01-30T08:08:27Z,2020-01-30T11:59:39Z,2020-01-30T08:08:26Z,362-384,NA,121,Cortex,From action to abstraction,NA,en,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\CWIJG4NG\Humphries et al. - 2019 - From action to abstraction The sensorimotor groun.pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\KPYECTGJ\S0010945219303235.html,NA,Parkinson's disease; Abstraction; Embodied cognition; Metaphor; Simulation,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000753,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\CWIJG4NG\Humphries et al. - 2019 - From action to abstraction The sensorimotor groun.pdf,TRUE

Results showed that degrading either collective ties (i.e., sentiments toward the group as a whole) or relational ties (i.e., sentiments toward individual group members) lowered identity fusion with the group (Studies 1–3 & 6). Lowered fusion, in turn, explained the tendency for weakened collective and relational ties to reduce endorsement of pro-group action, and this effect replicated cross-sectionally and longitudinally (Studies 2, 4 & 6). Additional evidence revealed that attenuated group-related agency seemed to mediate the relationship between weakened identity fusion and diminished commitment to help the group (Studies 3, 4 & 6). Although degrading collective ties reduced overall group identification (Studies 1–3 & 6), degrading relational ties did not reliably do so (Studies 1–6). Instead, degrading relational ties only reduced scores on a single component (ingroup solidarity) of a multidimensional measure of group identification (Studies 5 & 6). Hence, measures of identity fusion are equally sensitive to relational and collective ties while measures of identification emphasize collective ties. The results replicated whether we considered country (Studies 1–5) or gender (i.e. females, Study 6) as the focal social group.

Here, we examined how prediction error responses behave in a more complex and ecologically valid auditory context than those typically studied. We created musical tone sequences with different degrees of pitch uncertainty to manipulate the precision of participants' auditory expectations. Magnetoencephalography was used to measure the magnetic counterpart of the mismatch negativity (MMNm) as a neural marker of prediction error in a multi-feature paradigm. Pitch, slide, intensity and timbre deviants were included. We compared high-entropy stimuli, consisting of a set of non-repetitive melodies, with low-entropy stimuli consisting of a simple, repetitive pitch pattern. Pitch entropy was quantitatively assessed with an information-theoretic model of auditory expectation. We found a reduction in pitch and slide MMNm amplitudes in the high-entropy as compared to the low-entropy context. No significant differences were found for intensity and timbre MMNm amplitudes. Furthermore, in a separate behavioral experiment investigating the detection of pitch deviants, similar decreases were found for accuracy measures in response to more fine-grained increases in pitch entropy. Our results are consistent with a precision modulation of auditory prediction error in a musical context, and suggest that this effect is specific to features that depend on the manipulated dimension—pitch information, in this case.",2019-11-01,2020-01-30T07:55:46Z,2020-01-30T11:13:46Z,2020-01-30T07:55:46Z,181-200,NA,120,Cortex,NA,NA,en,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\I9Z5H5PH\Quiroga-Martinez et al. - 2019 - Reduced prediction error responses in high-as comp.pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\TC4IJGN9\S0010945219302412.html,NA,IDyOM; Mismatch negativity; Multi-feature; Music; Precision; Prediction error,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000759,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\I9Z5H5PH\Quiroga-Martinez et al. - 2019 - Reduced prediction error responses in high-as comp.pdf,TRUE

This empirical regularity, known as “post error slowing” (PES), has been traditionally interpreted as the result of a conservative response criterion adopted to avoid future errors and it is supposed to be driven by changes in the excitability of the motor system. However, the consequences of errors have been almost exclusively investigated by means of button-press tasks, which have been criticized because of their limited ecological validity and it is still unclear to what extent errors bias the motor system activity during the planning and the on-line control of complex and realistic goal-directed actions. To overcome these potential limitations, in the present study, we investigated the effect of errors on the preparation and execution of the reach-to-grasp movement, one of the most significant daily life actions. In addition to reaction times (RTs), we measured motor-evoked potential (MEP) to explore the influence of errors on corticospinal (CS) excitability, and we applied kinematical analysis to examine the underlying reorganization of the movement following an error. The results of the present study showed that MEPs tend to be reduced after the failure to reach and grasp an object, supporting the traditional interpretation of PES. Furthermore, in addition to RTs, we found that error-reactivity strategically influences the grasping component of the action, whereas the reaching component appears to be impermeable to PES. These findings demonstrate that the error-reactivity is a strong empirical phenomenon, which spreads into the motor system at the level of both movement preparation and execution, even when more realistic and ecologically valid tasks are used.",2019-11-01,2020-01-30T07:56:40Z,2020-01-30T11:28:47Z,2020-01-30T07:56:40Z,92-100,NA,120,Cortex,NA,NA,en,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\WCHRMKGN\Ceccarini et al. - 2019 - Changes in corticospinal excitability associated w.pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\HTYBUQCP\S0010945219302254.html,NA,Transcranial magnetic stimulation; Kinematics; Motor-evoked potentials; Post error slowing; Reach-to-grasp,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000761,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\WCHRMKGN\Ceccarini et al. - 2019 - Changes in corticospinal excitability associated w.pdf,TRUE

Yet the effects of the match between the response associated with the cued object’s identity and the response associated with the target (compatibility effects), which are diagnostic of attentional engagement, were observed only with relevant-color onset cues. These findings demonstrate that stimulus- and goal-driven capture have qualitatively different consequences: Before attention is reoriented to the target, it is engaged to the location of the critical distractor following goal-driven capture but not stimulus-driven capture.

This convention ensures that perceptual impairment arising from developmental prosopagnosia can be distinguished from problems arising from a lack of visual experience with particular facial ethnicities – the so-called ‘Other-Ethnicity Effect’. The present study sought to determine whether the perceptual difficulties seen in developmental prosopagnosia – diagnosed using same-ethnicity faces – extend to other-ethnicity faces. First, we sought to determine whether a group of Caucasian developmental prosopagnosics (N = 15) and typical Caucasian controls (N = 30) had similar experience with same- and other-ethnicity faces during development. All participants therefore completed a contact questionnaire that enquired about their experience of Caucasian, Black, and East Asian faces, at different developmental stages. Importantly, the two groups described very similar levels of visual experience with other-ethnicity faces. Second, we administered a sequential matching task to measure participants' ability to discriminate same- (Caucasian) and other-ethnicity (Black, East Asian) faces. Relative to the experience-matched controls, the prosopagnosics were less accurate at discriminating both same- and other-ethnicity faces, and we found no evidence of disproportionate impairment for same-ethnicity faces. Given that the prosopagnosics and controls had similar opportunity to develop visual expertise for other-ethnicity faces, these results indicate that developmental prosopagnosia impairs recognition of both same- and other-ethnicity faces. The fact that developmental prosopagnosia affects the perception of both same- and other-ethnicity faces suggests that different facial ethnicities engage similar visual processing mechanisms. Our findings support the view that susceptibility to developmental prosopagnosia, and a lack of contact with other-ethnicity faces, contribute independently to the poor recognition of other-ethnicity faces.",2019-10-01,2020-01-30T07:35:08Z,2020-01-30T07:39:30Z,2020-01-30T07:35:08Z,12-19,NA,119,Cortex,NA,NA,en,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\2V4X8AFP\Cenac et al. - 2019 - Does developmental prosopagnosia impair identifica.pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\RIHL78TU\S0010945219301662.html,NA,Face recognition; Developmental prosopagnosia; Other-ethnicity faces; Visual experience,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000765,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\2V4X8AFP\Cenac et al. - 2019 - Does developmental prosopagnosia impair identifica.pdf,TRUE

We suggest that Western-born Muslims are particularly vulnerable to the impact of perceived relative deprivation because comparisons with majority groups’ peers are more salient for them than for individuals born elsewhere. Thus, we hypothesized that Western-born, compared with foreign-born, Muslims would score higher on four predictors of extremism (e.g., violent intentions), and group-based deprivation would explain these differences. Studies 1 to 6 (Ns = 59, 232, 259, 243, 104, and 366, respectively) confirmed that Western-born Muslims scored higher on all examined predictors of extremism.

Typically, these hypotheses have been investigated by using difference scores or other profile similarity indices as predictors of the outcome variables. These approaches, however, have been vigorously criticized for their conceptual and statistical shortcomings. Here, we introduce a statistical method that is based on polynomial regression and addresses most of these shortcomings: dyadic response surface analysis. This model is tailored for similarity effect hypotheses and fully accounts for the dyadic nature of relationship data. Furthermore, we provide a tutorial with an illustrative example and reproducible R and Mplus scripts that should assist substantive researchers in precisely formulating, testing, and interpreting their dyadic similarity effect hypotheses. ? 2018 European Association of Personality Psychology",2018-11-01,2019-03-20T17:41:35Z,2019-03-20T17:42:21Z,2019-03-20T17:41:35Z,627-641,6,32,European Journal of Personality,NA,NA,NA,NA,onlinelibrary.wiley.com (Atypon),NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\D58RBC8K\Schönbrodt e.a. - 2018 - Testing Similarity Effects with Dyadic Response Su.pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\HZTZMSGD\per.html,NA,polynomial regression; response surface analysis; similarity; congruence; dyadic data,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2018,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000767,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\D58RBC8K\Schönbrodt e.a. - 2018 - Testing Similarity Effects with Dyadic Response Su.pdf,TRUE

Both a store-brand chocolate (within-category substitute) and a granola bar (cross-category substitute), for example, can serve as substitutes for gourmet chocolate. Here, we found that people believe that within-category substitutes, which are more similar to desired stimuli, will more effectively satisfy their cravings than will cross-category substitutes (Experiments 1, 2a, and 2b). However, because within-category substitutes are more similar than cross-category substitutes to desired stimuli, they are more likely to evoke an unanticipated negative contrast effect.

Incremental-induced participants blamed a person showing consistently maladaptive levels of the trait more than did entity-induced participants. Increased blame was mediated by increased perceived control over behavior. Study 3 (N=107) extended findings regarding lay theories of empathy to protagonists in short narratives.

By using within-person designs in a laboratory (Study 1; 187 participants) and an ambulatory assessment study (Study 2; 125 participants), we sought to clarify this ambiguity by investigating whether prominent situational variables (such as motivation and affect) or personality traits can help elucidate when ego depletion can be observed and when not. Although only marginal ego-depletion effects were found in both studies, these effects varied considerably between individuals, indicating that some individuals experience self-control decrements after initial self-control exertion and others not. However, neither motivation nor affect nor personality traits such as trait self-control could consistently explain this variability when models were applied that controlled for variance due to targets and the depletion manipulation (Study 1) or days (Study 2) as well as for multiple testing.

Namely, insecure parental attachment (i.e., higher attachment-based anxiety and avoidance scores; Fraley, Heffernan, Vicary, & Brumbaugh, 2011b) can compromise emotion regulation and affect. However, although previous attachment research has addressed emotions during daily positive events (Gentzler, Kerns, & Keener, 2010), to our knowledge no studies have evaluated participants’ attachment in relation to their emotions during major positive life events that involve their parents (e.g., a wedding or holiday). Thus, the present study aimed to evaluate this and extend previous research (Gentzler & Kerns, 2006; Gentzler et al., 2010; Sheinbaum et al., 2015). This is important because major positive life events might solidify internal working models of attachment. Additionally, secure attachment and savoring positive emotions correlate with well-being. Participants (N = 310; Mage = 31.26) completed measures of attachment (i.e., attachment-based anxiety and avoidance) and emotions (e.g., joy, stress) in positive life events involving parents. Results of multiple hierarchical regression showed that insecure attachment predicted decreased joy (p < .001) and increased stress (p < .001) for positive events, after controlling for gender and age. Similarly, for imagined future events, insecure attachment predicted less positive emotions (p < .001) and more negative emotions (p < .001). These results imply that parental attachment can negatively impact positive emotions such as joy during positive life events.

In a sample of 411 children between the ages of 6 and 14 years, we found consistent gender differences in endorsement of communal and agentic values. Across this age range, boys endorsed communal values less and agentic values more than did girls. Moreover, gender differences in values partially accounted for boys’ relatively lower family versus career orientation, predicting their orientation over and above gender identification and parent reports of children’s gender expression.

To address this question, we tested the association between personality profile normativeness (similarity between one's personality profile and the average profile—a proxy for the deviancy–adjustment continuum) and creativity across four different samples (total N = 348 768). We used a wide range of creativity measures, including self-reported, informant-reported, behavioural, and occupational creativity, as well as several essential statistical controls (i.e., demographics, socio-economic background, intelligence, and life satisfaction). Furthermore, we employed both cross-sectional and longitudinal designs, including samples of college students and representative adult populations. We found that people who had more normative personality profiles were more creative. However, this association only held within modality (i.e. when both personality and creativity were either self-reported or informant-reported). We did not find robust associations between personality profile normativeness and laboratory-based behavioural measures of creativity, occupational creativity, or creative achievements. We discuss alternative explanations for the observed adjustment–creativity link, specifically, implicit theories of creativity and person perception biases (halo effects). Notably, the findings did not support the idea that deviancy breeds creativity, suggesting that the famed ‘mad genius’ hypothesis might not hold among the general population. © 2019 European Association of Personality Psychology",2019,2020-01-30T12:48:48Z,2020-01-30T12:50:08Z,2020-01-30T12:48:48Z,565-588,5,33,NA,Creating Through Deviancy or Adjustment?,NA,en,© 2019 European Association of Personality Psychology,Wiley Online Library,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\8VGVCQQK\Sutu et al. - 2019 - Creating Through Deviancy or Adjustment The Link .pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\DGMGDK8Q\per.html,NA,longitudinal; adjustment; creativity; mad genius; personality profile,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000783,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\8VGVCQQK\Sutu et al. - 2019 - Creating Through Deviancy or Adjustment The Link .pdf,TRUE

Yet, despite dramatic changes in women's sex hormone levels and bodies during and after pregnancy, previous between-subject and case studies have not found systematic changes in F0 due to pregnancy. Here, we tracked within-individual variation in 20 mothers' voices during their first pregnancy, as well as up to 5 years before conception and 5 years postpartum. Voice recordings from 20 age-matched nulliparous women were measured as a control. Linear Mixed Models indicated that F0 mean, range and variation changed significantly following pregnancy in mothers, controlling for age at time of recording, whereas we did not observe any F0 changes across corresponding timeframes in our sample of nulliparous controls. Mothers' voices became significantly lower-pitched and more monotonous during the first year postpartum compared to during pregnancy or before. These F0 parameters did not decrease within-individuals over a 5-year period prior to conception above and beyond the effects of ageing. Although voice pitch decreased following pregnancy, mothers' F0 parameters reverted after the first year postpartum, approaching pre-pregnancy levels.

To many, however, years of reliance on this approach has resulted in a crisis of inference across the social and behavioral sciences (e.g., Rouder et al., 2016). As an alternative to the null hypothesis testing approach, many such experts recommend the Bayesian hypothesis testing approach. Adopting an open-science framework, the present study (a) re-evaluates the empirical findings of 418 t-tests from published L2 research using Bayesian hypothesis testing, and (b) compares the Bayesian results with their conventional, null hypothesis testing counterparts as observed in the original reports. The results show that the Bayesian and the null hypothesis testing approaches generally arrive at similar inferential conclusions. However, considerable differences arise in the rejections of the null hypothesis. Notably, in 64.06% of cases when p-values fell between .01 and .05 (i.e., evidence to reject the null), the Bayesian analysis found the evidence in the primary studies to be only at an ‘anecdotal’ level (i.e., insufficient evidence to reject the null).

Participants (n = 315) completed a survey assessing their chronic ostracism experiences, dispositional need to belong, and Twitter behavior, particularly regarding potential parasocial relationship targets (n = 229).

Objective measures and subjective ratings of male sexually dimorphic traits purportedly under sexual selection (height, vocal and facial masculinity, upper body size from 3D scans, physical strength, and baseline testosterone) and observer perceptions of physical dominance and sexual attractiveness based on self-presentation video recordings were assessed and associated with mating success (sociosexual behaviour and number of potential conceptions) in a partly longitudinal design. Results from structural equation models and selection analyses revealed that physical dominance, but not sexual attractiveness, predicted mating success.

This developmental difference also occurs for judgments of immoral actors: Three- to 5-year-olds again prefer the person who is not conflicted, whereas older children and adults judge that someone who struggles with the decision is morally superior.

There are six separate datasets, with each of three combinations of meteorological driving data (two observation-based and one from climate model ensembles) used to produce two types of outputs (daily time-series of natural river flow for 260 sites, and monthly 1 ? 1 km grids of natural flow and soil moisture in the unsaturated zone). The driving data required by G2G are rainfall and potential evaporation (PE). Two of the datasets from observation-based driving data use rainfall from CEH-GEAR (CEH-Gridded Estimates of Areal Rainfall) with PE from MORECS (Met Office Rainfall and Evaporation Calculation System), and cover the period 1960?2015, while the other two use CEH-GEAR rainfall with PE derived from 5 km temperature data using the Oudin method, and cover 1891?2015. The two datasets based on driving data (rainfall and PE) from the climate model ensembles cover three periods: Historical Baseline (1900?2006), Near-Future (2020?2049), and Far-Future (2070?2099). Data for a 30-year Baseline period (1975?2004), against which the Near-Future and Far-Future periods should be compared, are also available directly. There are 100 members in each ensemble, and the future periods use the RCP8.5 emissions scenario. This paper provides details of the G2G model and the different sets of meteorological driving data, as well as the availability and formatting of the output datasets. It also describes some recent and potential applications of the datasets, which have already been used to support historical and future analyses of low flow and drought characteristics across Britain, and provides some guidance on how the climate model-driven datasets should (and should not) be used.

Research suggests that, at peak fertility, women tend to prefer men with characteristics that reflect good genes for short-term sexual relationships. However, existing findings have been criticized for methodological flexibility and failing attempts to replicate core results. In a large (N=157), pre-registered, within-subject study spanning two ovulatory cycles, we investigated cycle shifts in women's mate preferences for masculine bodies. Using a large set of natural stimuli, we found that when fertile, women's ratings of male bodies increased for sexual as well as for long-term attractiveness. Both effects were partially mediated by the estradiol-to-progesterone-ratio. Furthermore, moderation analyses revealed that both shifts were only evident in women in relationships, but not in singles. Contrary to previous findings, male masculine traits did not interact with cycle phase to predict attraction, indicating that women's preferential priorities do not shift. Taken together, our results do not support women's mate preference shifts, as assumed by the good genes ovulatory shift hypothesis, but are consistent with shifting motivational priorities throughout the cycle.

Study 1 investigated whether variation in the diagnosticity of individuating information moderated stereotype bias in implicit and explicit person perception. Increases in diagnosticity produced a linear reduction in explicit and implicit stereotype bias; with more diagnostic individuating information, there was less bias. Studies 2 and 3 examined the effects on person perception of racial stereotypes and of diagnostic individuating information that varied in valence. Study 2 found no substantial implicit or explicit anti-Black stereotype bias in the presence of diagnostic individuating information and large individuating information effects on explicit person perception. Study 3 found no explicit anti-Black stereotype bias in the presence of diagnostic individuating information and that individuating information influenced both implicit and explicit person perception. Together, these studies showed that individuating information can reduce or eliminate stereotype bias in implicit and explicit person perception and that its effect depends on the diagnosticity of the information.

We demonstrate this by                     showing that (a) master’s-degree universities use the word                         university to describe themselves more than major graduate                     universities do, (b) small international airports use the word                         international to describe themselves more than major                     airports do, and (c) University of Pennsylvania students, who are affiliated                     with a “marginal” Ivy League school, use the word Ivy to                     describe their school more than Harvard students do.",2014-10-01,2018-03-21T00:29:00Z,2018-03-21T00:29:09Z,2018-03-21T00:29:00Z,1955-1959,10,25,Psychol Sci,Asymmetrical Social Mach Bands,NA,en,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\DL6B6KDX\Rozin et al. - 2014 - Asymmetrical Social Mach Bands Exaggeration of So.pdf,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,2014,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000801,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\DL6B6KDX\Rozin et al. - 2014 - Asymmetrical Social Mach Bands Exaggeration of So.pdf,TRUE

Critically, misinformation led to improved recognition of the original event when subjects detected and remembered a change between the original event and the postevent information. Our research agrees with other findings from retroactive-interference paradigms and can be interpreted within the recursive-remindings framework, according to which detecting and remembering change can enhance retention.

Three studies provide support for our interpretation of the Napoleon complex. Our pilot study shows that men (but not women) keep more resources for themselves when they feel small. When paired with a taller male opponent (Study 1), shorter men keep more resources to themselves in a game in which they have all the power (dictator game) versus a game in which the opponent also has some power (ultimatum game). Furthermore, shorter men are not more likely to show direct, physical aggression toward a taller opponent (Study 2).

We investigated how social (vicarious) fear learning is affected by empathic appraisals by asking participants to either enhance or decrease their empathic responses to another individual (the demonstrator), who received electric shocks paired with a predictive conditioned stimulus. A third group of participants received no appraisal instructions and responded naturally to the demonstrator. During a later test, participants who had enhanced their empathy evinced the strongest vicarious fear learning as measured by skin conductance responses to the conditioned stimulus in the absence of the demonstrator. Moreover, this effect was augmented in observers high in trait empathy.

The more people merely watch others perform (without actually practicing themselves), the more they nonetheless believe they could perform the skill, too (Experiment 1). However, people’s actual abilities—from throwing darts and doing the moonwalk to playing an online game—do not improve after merely watching others, despite predictions to the contrary (Experiments 2–4). What do viewers see that makes them think they are learning? We found that extensive viewing allows people to track what steps to take (Experiment 5) but not how those steps feel when taking them.

Drawing on two samples (N = 413, Mage = 15.29, and N = 530, Mage = 31.75), we applied an extension procedure for confirmatory factor analysis that enables a simultaneous investigation of the relationships on all levels. The perseverance facet of grit was tightly aligned to the common factors (95% shared variance) and was strongly related to the industriousness factor. Consistency shared less variance with the common factors of conscientiousness (53%), but it was additionally correlated with the self-discipline facet. The results for the global grit scale were most similar to the results for perseverance.

From labor-market entry to middle age, individuals with low self-control experienced 1.6 times as many months of unemployment as those with high self-control.

Modern reinforcement-learning theories formalize this distinction as a competition between a computationally cheap but inaccurate model-free system that gives rise to habits and a computationally expensive but accurate model-based system that implements planning. It is unclear, however, how people choose to allocate control between these systems. Here, we propose that arbitration occurs by comparing each system’s task-specific costs and benefits. To investigate this proposal, we conducted two experiments showing that people increase model-based control when it achieves greater accuracy than model-free control, and especially when the rewards of accurate performance are amplified. In contrast, they are insensitive to reward amplification when model-based and model-free control yield equivalent accuracy.

When two agents refuse to help, children retain a preference for the more competent agent but infer that the less competent agent is nicer.

Many studies have investigated the nomological network of multidimensional perfectionism by relating perfectionistic concerns and perfectionistic strivings to the Big Five personality traits. Results from these studies were largely inconsistent. In the present study, we meta-analytically integrated 672 effect sizes from 72 samples (N = 21 573) describing relations between multidimensional perfectionism and the Big Five personality traits. Perfectionistic concerns correlated positively with Neuroticism (r = 0.383) and negatively with Extraversion (r = −0.198), Agreeableness (r = −0.198), Conscientiousness (r = −0.111), and Openness (r = −0.087). Perfectionistic strivings correlated positively with Conscientiousness (r = 0.368), Openness (r = 0.121), Neuroticism (r = 0.090), and Extraversion (r = 0.067) and were unrelated to Agreeableness (r = 0.002). The measures of perfectionistic concerns and perfectionistic strivings moderated most of these relations. Meta-analytic structural equation modelling allowed controlling each perfectionism dimension for the respective other. This partialling increased all correlations with the exception of the previously positive correlation between perfectionistic strivings and Neuroticism, which ceased to be significant.

Moreover, we address three major methodological limitations of previous research in this area: a lack of an unconstrained control condition; non-compliance with time manipulations leading to high rates of exclusions and thus a selection bias; and non-comprehension of the structure of the game.

We show that when we controlled for additive area, observers were unable to discriminate on the basis of true area, per se, and that these results could not be explained by other spatial dimensions.

Here, observers estimated the average emotion of a crowd of dynamic faces. The members of some crowds changed their expressions synchronously, whereas individuals in other crowds acted asynchronously.

We integrated the social-projection and stress-mindset literatures to investigate, for the first time, the effect of holding a stress-is-enhancing, versus a stress-is-debilitating, mindset on social judgments of a target's strain, on the perceiver's consequent perceptions of the target's promotability, and on his or her intention to voluntarily help the target. We argued that perceivers may project their own stress-mindsets onto others, resulting in egocentrically-biased judgments of the latter's strain. We conducted four experimental and correlational studies, among 971 fully-employed Americans and Israelis, using a novel stress-mindset manipulation. We predicted and found evidence that, independent of the effects of mood, individuals holding a stress-is-enhancing versus a stress-is-debilitating mindset were less likely to judge a target experiencing a heavy workload as suffering from burnout, somatic symptoms, or presenteeism (i.e., reduced productivity at work due to health problems). We also revealed two important downstream outcomes: whereas the lower strain judgments associated with a stress-is-enhancing mindset led to a higher estimate of the target's promotability, they also led to a lower likelihood of helping him. Taken together, our findings establish a causal link between stress-mindset and judgments of others' strain, thereby extending the novel notion of stress-mindset beyond intra-personal outcomes to inter-personal effects.

Results showed that there was a medium effect (r = .34) of repetition on incidental vocabulary learning. Subsequent moderator analyses revealed that variability in the size of repetition effects across studies was explained by learner variables (age, vocabulary knowledge), treatment variables (spaced learning, visual support, engagement, range in number of encounters), and methodological differences (nonword use, forewarning of an upcoming comprehension test, vocabulary test format).

Eighty-six Dutch secondary-school students participated in one of two experimental conditions or in an animacy judgment (active control) condition. Participants in the phonological specificity training (with phonological manipulation) and the picture selection (without phonological manipulation) experimental conditions had to select the corresponding picture from among competitors after hearing a word. Phonological specificity training resulted in increased learning (measured through word translation) compared to the control condition on the posttest whereas picture selection produced increased learning only for participants with larger initial vocabulary sizes. Both experimental conditions showed increased learning for participants with larger vocabulary sizes on the retention test. Compared to picture selection, phonological specificity training showed more learning immediately after intervention for words with nonnative contrasts.

Yet current practice is to use statistical tests with an inappropriate null hypothesis of no difference, which can result in equating nonsignificant differences with significant homogeneity. Instead, we argue that researchers should begin with the initial hypothesis that the data are inconsistent with a valid research design, and provide sufficient statistical evidence in favor of a valid design. When tests are correctly specified so that difference is the null and equivalence is the alternative, the problems afflicting traditional tests are alleviated. We argue that equivalence tests are better able to incorporate substantive considerations about what constitutes good balance on covariates and placebo outcomes than traditional tests.

Overall, we found a reliable sensitivity to L2 morphosyntax at advanced proficiencies (d = .20, 95% CIs .15, .25), with some evidence that this was reliably lower than for native speakers (NSs). These patterns were not generally moderated by linguistic feature or sentence region.

We devised a novel, touch-screen-based, sequential object-transfer task to measure how people choose between different paths to coordinate with a partner.

In the present study, participants rated actions of other individuals as more natural when limb movements (as a cause) occurred before body displacements (as an effect) than when limb movements temporally lagged behind body displacements. This causal expectation for human body movements not only affected perceptual impressions regarding the naturalness of observed actions but also guided the interpretation of motion cues within a more generalized causal context.

Capraro and Rand (Judgment and Decision Making, 13, 99–111, 2018) recently provided experimental evidence that prosociality in anonymous, one-shot interactions (such as Prisoner's Dilemma and Dictator Game experiments) is not driven by outcome-based social preferences – as classically assumed – but by a generalized morality preference for “doing the right thing”. Here we argue that the key experiments reported in Capraro and Rand (2018) comprise prominent methodological confounds and open questions that bear on influential psychological theory. Specifically, their design confounds: (i) preferences for efficiency with self-interest; and (ii) preferences for action with preferences for morality. Furthermore, their design fails to dissociate the preference to do “good” from the preference to avoid doing “bad”.

When role demands to maximize candidate fit in hiring selections were strong, preference for job candidates of a given group tended to be lower when there were cues to third-party prejudice against that group (vs. no cues), irrespective of in-group favoritism effects (Studies 1–5) or participant attitudes (Studies 4 and 5). We found supporting evidence for the underlying processes in the context of hiring selections involving fictional groups (Study 1) as well as female job candidates (Studies 2–5). A concern with meeting the demands of the gatekeeper role was at the root of prejudice accommodation: When role-demands to prioritize candidate fit were strong, role-relevant considerations (interpersonal and task-focused) mediated the accommodation effect (Studies 1 and 4). The more gatekeepers in charge of hiring sought to meet role demands by considering the preferences of relevant third parties, the more they accommodated third-party prejudice (Study 2). Moreover, role-based concerns mediated the accommodation of prejudice—but not other potential considerations that were unrelated to role demands (Study 3). Finally, the accommodation effect was eliminated when the role definition did not prioritize candidate fit (Study 4) and when we experimentally reduced the strength of role-related concerns (Study 5).

With precise measurements of each chick’s behavior, we were able to perform individual-level analyses and substantially reduce measurement error for the group-level analyses. We found no evidence that newborn chicks encode the TPs between sequentially presented shapes. None of the chicks showed evidence for this ability.

In the original study, participants either circled first-person plural (interdependent condition) or singular pronouns (independent condition) when reading a passage and subsequently memorized and recalled a set of objects presented on a visual-spatial grid. When employing a digital version of the original procedure, we were able to replicate the original findings, with better recall of objects in their original location in the interdependent (vs. independent) condition. Notably, the effect of self-construal priming on spatial memory was strongest when screening out participants who did not comply with instructions on the pronoun task and absent when including non-compliant participants. Moreover, in contrast to the original study, effects of priming were not specific to object-&-location operationalization of spatial memory recall, and also present for location-independent object recall and object-independent spatial placement recall. Additionally, condition effects were robust across observed cultural differences: Though white participants performing less successfully compared to non-white participants, both groups were comparably susceptible to priming effects.

Across three student samples and two clinical samples, we investigated whether trait decentering moderated the relationship of negative affect and positive affect with a variety of internalizing symptoms, as well as with narcissism, mania, and anhedonia.

We employed a dual-target neurostimulation approach in 30 healthy participants, using cortico-cortical paired associative stimulation (ccPAS) to target two key nodes: lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) and intraparietal sulcus (IPS), to test whether decision-making can be artificially shifted from habitual toward goal-directed control. Participants received three active stimulations, delivered at least six days apart (each involving 100 paired pulses over the IPS and LPFC, varying the interstimulus interval): two interventional, time-relevant ccPAS (10 msec interval) and one control, non-time-relevant ccPAS (100 msec interval). Following stimulation, participants completed a sequential learning task, measuring goal-directed/habitual control, and a working memory task. IPS→LPFC ccPAS (stimulating IPS, then LPFC with a 10 msec interval) shifted decision-making from habitual toward goal-directed control, compared to control ccPAS. There was no effect of LPFC→IPS ccPAS, nor an effect of any PAS condition on working memory. Previous studies have shown ccPAS effects outside the motor domain targeting prefrontal regions on response inhibition, attentional bias, and alpha asymmetry. The present study measures the behavioural effects of parietal-prefrontal PAS, focusing on a highly complex decision-making task and working memory. If confirmed in larger studies, this would be the first instance of neurostimulation successfully shifting decision-making from habitual to goal-directed control, putatively via inducing long-term potentiation between the IPS and LPFC. However, we found no effect in the other direction (LPFC→IPS ccPAS), and no effect on working memory overall. PAS is a relatively new neuromodulatory technique in the cognitive arsenal, and this study could help guide future approaches in healthy and disordered decision-making.",2019-08-01,2020-01-30T07:19:07Z,2020-01-30T07:19:32Z,2020-01-30T07:19:07Z,266-276,NA,117,Cortex,NA,NA,en,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\GJBXCWMC\Nord et al. - 2019 - The effect of frontoparietal paired associative st.pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\ULUNX7LW\S0010945219301315.html,NA,Decision-making; Goal-directed; Habitual; Paired associative stimulation; Psychiatry,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000891,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\GJBXCWMC\Nord et al. - 2019 - The effect of frontoparietal paired associative st.pdf,TRUE

It was hypothesized that adolescents who show more deviation from the classroom norm in personality experience more peer victimization. Data from 1108 adolescents (48% boys; Mage = 13.56 years, SD = 1.13) from 54 classrooms were used to test this hypothesis. Data included measurements of self?reported and bully?disclosed victimization and Big Five and Dark Triad personality traits. Results of generalized linear mixed models including polynomial equations and subsequent response surface analyses partly supported our hypothesis. Person?group dissimilarity in the shape of personality profiles was related to more bully?disclosed victimization, but not to self?reported victimization. Dissimilarity in neuroticism and Machiavellianism was related to both more self?reported and bully?disclosed victimization. Dissimilarity in extraversion, openness to experience, and psychopathy was only related to more self?reported victimization. Unexpectedly, dissimilarity in agreeableness was related to less self?reported victimization. Moreover, our results also indicated that certain levels of congruent person?group combinations in agreeableness, neuroticism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy were related to more peer victimization. Overall, findings of this study emphasize the importance of considering classroom norms in relation to peer victimization.

However, these dilemmas are usually unrealistic thought experiments, with implausibly few options and implausible statements about the consequences of these options. The present research examines whether variations in dilemma plausibility influence moral judgments. This influence might result from two psychological factors—cost–benefit calculations and reactance-type processes. Both can be predicted to cause more deontological judgments for implausible compared to plausible moral dilemmas. In two experiments (total N = 417), dilemmas were modified to create a plausible and an implausible version without altering the actions and their alleged consequences. We observed that low (compared to high) plausibility within dilemmas increased deontological judgments. Consequently, varying plausibility constitutes a potential confound when examining moral cognition by comparing different dilemma versions.

Here, we manipulated covert spatial attention and had participants (total N = 48) reproduce multiple properties (color, orientation, location) of a target item. Object-feature binding was assessed by applying probabilistic models to the joint distribution of feature errors: Feature reports for the same object could be correlated (and thus bound together) or independent. We found that splitting attention across multiple locations degrades object integrity, whereas rapid shifts of spatial attention maintain bound objects. Moreover, we document a novel attentional phenomenon, wherein participants exhibit unintentional fluctuations—lapses of spatial attention—yet nevertheless preserve object integrity at the wrong location. These findings emphasize the importance of a single focus of spatial attention for object-feature binding, even when that focus is dynamically moving across the visual field.",2019-03-01,2019-04-06T19:00:28Z,2020-02-11T05:26:39Z,NA,343-361,3,30,Psychol.

The current research tests a novel hypothesis that engaging in risky eating with friends increases feelings of interpersonal closeness. In Study 1, participants (N = 385) reported how often they engaged in risky eating in three non-romantic/non-familial relationships with varying degrees of interpersonal closeness. Individuals more frequently engaged in risky eating in their closer relationships than in their less close ones. In Study 2, participants (N = 100) were randomly assigned to perceive they were engaging in high-risk versus low-risk eating behavior with a friend. They then reported feelings of interpersonal closeness as well as chose how close to sit to their friend. Individuals who were randomly assigned to perceive they were engaging in high-risk eating behavior with a friend reported increased feelings of interpersonal closeness. Also, restrained eaters in the high-risk eating behavior condition reported greater feelings of interpersonal closeness while eating, which was mediated by increased feelings of activated positive affect (e.g., excited, alert). No effect on how close participants sat to their friend was observed. Overall, the current research highlights a previously unstudied pathway from risky eating to excitement to feelings of interpersonal closeness.

With respect to environmental influences, a growing literature implicates intrauterine experiences in the origin of this pervasive developmental disorder. In this prospective longitudinal study, we examined the hypothesis that fetal exposure to maternal cortisol may confer ASD risk. In addition, because ASD is four times more prevalent in males than in females, and because sexually dimorphic responses to intrauterine experiences are commonly observed, we examined whether or not any associations differ by fetal sex. Maternal plasma cortisol was measured at 15, 19, 25, 31, and 37 weeks’ gestation in a sample of 84 pregnant women. ASD symptoms were assessed in their 5-year-old children with the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ). Fetal exposure to lower levels of maternal cortisol was associated with higher levels of ASD symptoms only among boys. The observed hypocortisolemic profile exhibited by these mothers may indicate a risk factor that precedes the stress of caregiving for a child with ASD and may not be solely a consequence of the stress of caregiving, as previously thought.

Positive emotions are important for overall well-being and yet relatively neglected in research on chemosignaling, arguably because of the stronger survival benefits linked with negative emotions.

The present studies tested the hypotheses that over time, negative, but not positive, group information would generalize to other group members (Experiment 1) and to the self (Experiment 2). In Experiment 1, participants learned personal information about two members of two groups. Two members of one group were associated with negative trait information, while two members of the other group were associated with positive trait information. Participants then made trait and evaluative judgments about members of both groups. In Experiment 2, participants learned positive and negative information about their ingroup and an outgroup.

Across six studies we demonstrated that White women perceived a Black male expert as less likely than White men to hold negative stereotypes about women's intelligence (Study 1, 2), especially if women were high in stigma solidarity (Study 3, 6), mitigating cognitive interference (Study 2, 4). Further, an outgroup expert who was not similarly stereotyped (i.e., Asian male) did not mitigate these identity threat effects (Study 5, 6). Thus, we contend that White women, especially those high in stigma solidarity, perceive similarly stereotyped outgroup experts as less likely to hold negative stereotypes about their intelligence, buffering against identity threats in such settings.

To account for these findings, it has been proposed that exposure to expectancy-violating information enhances attention to context, which leads to an integration of the context into the representation of expectancy-violating counterattitudinal information. Although a considerable body of evidence supports these assumptions, it is still unclear whether contextualized attitude change is a general phenomenon that is robust across individuals or instead depends on psychological characteristics of the perceiver. To address this question, the current research tested whether contextualized attitude change is moderated by three individual difference variables that are known to influence responses to belief-incongruent information: preference for consistency, need for structure, and implicit theories of personality. Based on the hypothesis that contextualized attitude change is due to enhanced attention to context during encoding of expectancy-violating information, we hypothesized that individual differences along the three dimensions should moderate contextualized attitude change via differences in attention to context in response to expectancy-violating information. Contrary to this hypothesis, none of the three variables moderated contextualized attitude change (Experiments 1 and 2) and attention to context during exposure to expectancy-violating information (Experiment 3). Implications for the generality of contextualized attitude change, research on the three individual difference variables, and cognitive consistency more broadly are discussed.",2018-09-01,2019-03-30T16:42:28Z,2019-03-30T16:42:39Z,2019-03-30T16:42:28Z,148-161,NA,78,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\7D9YXEN4\Brannon en Gawronski - 2018 - Does contextualized attitude change depend on indi.pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\2GSDG66K\S0022103117306595.html,NA,Attitude change; Context effects; Implicit theories of personality; Need for structure; Preference for consistency,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2018,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000919,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\7D9YXEN4\Brannon en Gawronski - 2018 - Does contextualized attitude change depend on indi.pdf,TRUE

For example, an oft-documented finding is that citizens tend to view the state of the national economy more positively if their party holds office. These partisan perceptual gaps are usually taken as a result of citizens' own motivated reasoning to defend their party identity. However, little is known about the extent to which perceptual gaps are shaped by one of the most important forces in politics: partisan elites. With two studies focusing on perceptions of the economy—a quasi-experimental panel study and a randomized experiment—we show how partisan perceptual differences are substantially affected by messages coming from party elites.

Prior studies have focused mainly on typicality’s influence on attractiveness, although recent studies have cast doubt on its importance for attractiveness judgments. Here, we argue that face typicality is an important factor for social perception because it affects trustworthiness judgments, which approximate the basic evaluation of faces. This effect has been overlooked because trustworthiness and attractiveness judgments have a high level of shared variance for most face samples. We show that for a continuum of faces that vary on a typicality-attractiveness dimension, trustworthiness judgments peak around the typical face. In contrast, perceived attractiveness increases monotonically past the typical face, as faces become more like the most attractive face. These findings suggest that face typicality is an important determinant of face evaluation.",2015-01-01,2018-03-20T23:53:49Z,2018-03-20T23:54:52Z,2018-03-20T23:53:48Z,39-47,1,26,Psychol Sci,What Is Typical Is Good,NA,en,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\ZPHEJFZC\Sofer et al. - 2015 - What Is Typical Is Good The Influence of Face Typ.pdf,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2015,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000929,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\ZPHEJFZC\Sofer et al. - 2015 - What Is Typical Is Good The Influence of Face Typ.pdf,TRUE

In a short-term memory task, baboons memorized the location of two target squares of the same color, which were presented with a distractor of a different color. Through prior long-term conditioning, one of the two colors had acquired a negative valence. Subjects were slower and less accurate on the memory task when the targets were negative than when they were neutral. In contrast, subjects were faster and more accurate when the distractors were negative than when they were neutral. Some of these effects were modulated by individual differences in emotional disposition. Overall, the results reveal a pattern of cognitive avoidance of negative stimuli, and show that emotional value alters cognitive processing in baboons even when the stimuli are not physically present.

The perceptual asymmetry theory predicted that stimuli in the lower visual field would be processed more fluently and would therefore be perceived as more familiar. The working memory theory, originally proposed in space–number research, envisaged type-specific spatial patterns for different stimuli. Participants made old/new recognition memory judgements for stimuli, presented at random positions, while their eye movements were recorded. The observed spatial patterns changed according to the stimulus type (e.g., “more left = older” for horizontally written words and “upper = older” for vertically written words), and this flexibility is encapsulated by the working memory theory as follows: (a) stimulus-type-specific spatial configurations are encoded in long-term memory on the basis of one’s experience (e.g., vertically written words are empirically associated with the “upper = older” spatial configuration), (b) the presentation of a stimulus automatically cues the temporal activation of the associated spatial configuration in working memory, and (c) the referential process between the stimulus and configuration unconsciously affects the viewer’s sense of familiarity.",2019-04-01,2019-04-05T15:04:35Z,2019-04-05T15:04:54Z,2019-04-05T15:04:35Z,832-846,4,72,Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology,Systematic spatial patterns of the sense of familiarity,NA,en,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\P29S6DS3\Miyoshi and Ashida - 2019 - Systematic spatial patterns of the sense of famili.pdf,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000937,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\P29S6DS3\Miyoshi and Ashida - 2019 - Systematic spatial patterns of the sense of famili.pdf,TRUE

Eight times a day, electronic devices prompted subjects to report on their current thoughts and context. Working memory capacity and attention abilities predicted subjects’ TUT rates in the lab, but predicted the frequency of daily-life mind wandering only as a function of subjects’ momentary attempts to concentrate. This pattern replicates prior daily-life findings but conflicts with laboratory findings. Results for personality factors also revealed different associations in the lab and daily life: Only neuroticism predicted TUT rate in the lab, but only openness predicted mind-wandering rate in daily life (both predicted the content of daily-life mind wandering). Cognitive and personality factors also predicted dimensions of everyday thought other than mind wandering, such as subjective judgments of controllability of thought.

Intentional binding (i.e., when voluntary actions and their outcomes are perceived to occur closer together in time than involuntary actions and their outcomes) is increased in intentional action but requires no explicit reflection on agency. The reported experience of involuntariness is central to hypnotic responding, during which strategic action is experienced as involuntary. We report reduced intentional binding in a hypnotically induced experience of involuntariness, providing an objective correlate of reports of involuntariness.

The first segment either matched (congruent condition) or did not match (incongruent condition) the first syllable. The SSVEP responses in the congruent condition showed increased power compared to the responses in the incongruent condition, providing new evidence that syllables are important sublexical units in visual word recognition and reading aloud. With respect to the neural correlates of the effect, syllables elicited an early activation of a right hemisphere network.

We suggest that this is likely due to an overemphasis of the role of motor aspects of arm movement in these effects. The goal of this research is therefore to reevaluate the role of sensorimotor information in the production of compatibility effects by suggesting that large and replicable effects can be observed when the task simulates the visual information that comes with whole-body movements. In line with this idea, we present six experiments showing that such a task (the Visual Approach/Avoidance by the Self Task; VAAST) can produce large and replicable compatibility effects. Importantly, these experiments also test the core aspects producing these effects.

This similarity suggests that grouping and averaging are part of a broader set of strategies allowing the visual system to circumvent capacity limitations. To examine how gestalt grouping affects the manner in which information is averaged and remembered, I compared the error in observers’ adjustments of remembered sizes of individual circles in two different mean-size sets defined by similarity, proximity, connectedness, or a common region. Overall, errors were more similar within the same gestalt-defined groups than between different gestalt-defined groups, such that the remembered sizes of individual circles were biased toward the mean size of their respective gestalt-defined groups.

The dimensions of body-shape variation that emerged in a language-based similarity space were related to major dimensions of variation computed directly from three-dimensional laser scans of 2,094 bodies. This relationship allowed us to generate three-dimensional models of people in the shape space using only their coordinates on analogous dimensions in the language-based description space.

Contrary to conventional wisdom that citizens are passive consumers of propaganda, I show that they extract objective economic information from personal experience and local conditions. Moreover, I find that they give greater weight to this information where regional party dominance makes economic performance a clearer indicator of the ruling party's competence and when they believe the media are biased.

Federal laws have shaped policies addressing sexual assault in higher education. Title IX guidance requires universities to designate “Responsible Employees,” who are required to report all sexual assaults they learn about to the university (even if the survivor does not want to report). Resident assistants (RAs) are an important source of support for students and increasingly designated as Responsible Employees. University mandatory reporting policies have significant implications for reporters’ and survivors’ lives, but there is a lack of research on how Responsible Employees perceive this role. The current study examined Responsible Employee RA perceptions of mandatory reporting, the relationship between RAs’ experience of college sexual assault and perceptions of mandatory reporting, and whether trust in university response to sexual assault mediates this relationship. Data from 305 Responsible Employee RAs were analyzed. RAs’ perceptions of their reporting role were varied. For instance, RAs believed that mandatory reporting complicates their other responsibilities. College sexual assault survivors had less trust in university response to sexual assault, which, in turn, predicted more negative perceptions of mandatory reporting. Responsible Employees’ perceptions of mandatory reporting offer valuable insight into the potential effectiveness and drawbacks of these policies.",2019,2020-01-29T04:11:59Z,2020-01-29T04:12:20Z,2020-01-29T04:11:59Z,133-149,1,19,NA,NA,NA,en,© 2019 The Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues,Wiley Online Library,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\UFR5HRZD\Holland - 2019 - Examining Responsible Employees’ Perceptions of Se.pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\4XCYW8HR\asap.html,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000962,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\UFR5HRZD\Holland - 2019 - Examining Responsible Employees’ Perceptions of Se.pdf,TRUE

However, this assumption holds only in cases in which competing causes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive (i.e., exactly one cause is true). We argue that this reasoning error is due to a zero-sum perspective on evidence, wherein people assume that evidence that supports one causal hypothesis must disconfirm its competitor.

People are more willing to accept such utilitarian action when using a foreign language than when using their native language. In six experiments, we investigated why foreign-language use affects moral choice in this way. On the one hand, the difficulty of using a foreign language might slow people down and increase deliberation, amplifying utilitarian considerations of maximizing welfare. On the other hand, use of a foreign language might stunt emotional processing, attenuating considerations of deontological rules, such as the prohibition against killing. Using a process-dissociation technique, we found that foreign-language use decreases deontological responding but does not increase utilitarian responding.

These models seek to infer word representations from large text collections by predicting target words from neighbouring words (or vice versa). The resulting representations are vectors in a continuous space, collectively called word embeddings. Although psychological plausibility was not a primary concern for the developers of predictive models, it has been the topic of several recent studies in the field of psycholinguistics. That is, word embeddings have been linked to similarity ratings, word associations, semantic priming, word recognition latencies, and so on. Here, we build on this work by investigating category structure. Throughout seven experiments, we sought to predict human typicality judgements from two languages, Dutch and English, using different semantic spaces. More specifically, we extracted a number of predictor variables, and evaluated how well they could capture the typicality gradient of common categories (e.g., birds, fruit, vehicles, etc.). Overall, the performance of predictive models was rather modest and did not compare favourably with that of an older count-based model.

We propose to clarify the link between self?worth and ideology by distinguishing between narcissistic and non?narcissistic self?evaluations as well as between different dimensions of ideological attitudes. Four studies, conducted in three different socio?political contexts: the UK (Study 1, N = 422), the US (Studies 2 and 3, Ns = 471 and 289, respectively), and Poland (Study 4, N = 775), investigated the associations between narcissistic and non?narcissistic self?evaluations, social dominance orientation (SDO), right?wing authoritarianism (RWA), and ethnic prejudice. Confirming our hypotheses, the results consistently showed that after controlling for self?esteem, narcissistic self?evaluation was positively associated with SDO (accounting for RWA), yet negatively associated with RWA (accounting for SDO). These associations were similar after controlling for psychopathy and Machiavellianism (Study 3) as well as collective narcissism and Big Five personality characteristics (Study 4). Studies 2?4 additionally demonstrated that narcissistic self?evaluation was indirectly positively associated with prejudice through higher SDO (free of RWA) but indirectly negatively associated with prejudice through lower RWA (free of SDO). Implications for understanding the role of self?evaluation in right?wing ideological attitudes and prejudice are discussed. Copyright ? 2017 The Authors.

Testosterone’s effects were rapid (~30 min after administration) and mediated, in part, by subjective reward associated with aggression. Testosterone thus appears to promote human aggression through an AR-related mechanism and to have stronger effects in men with the select personality profiles because it more strongly upregulates the subjective pleasure they derive from aggression.

In a now seminal study, Zajonc, Heingartner, and Herman (ZHH) (1969) demonstrated that the audience effect of social facilitation was exhibited in the Blatta orientalis cockroach: cockroaches were faster to complete a simple task (traversing a runway) when among other cockroaches than when alone, yet slower when the task was complex (traversing a maze). This finding suggested that arousal was a likely driver of social facilitation in the cockroach (since self-aware mechanisms were unlikely to apply). It also invited consideration of the possibility that arousal may be a contributing factor to social facilitation in humans.

But we know little about how people form these ideas about their likes and dislikes in the first place, in part because of a dearth of paradigms that enable researchers to experimentally change people's attribute preferences. Drawing on theory and methods in covariation detection and social cognition, we developed a paradigm that examines how people infer summarized preferences for novel attributes from functional attribute preferences: the extent to which the attribute predicts an individual's evaluations across multiple targets (e.g., a person's tendency to positively evaluate mates who are more vs. less attractive). In three studies, participants encountered manipulated information about their own functional preference for a novel attribute in a set of targets. They then inferred a summarized preference for the attribute. Summarized preferences corresponded strongly to the functional preference manipulation when targets varied on only one attribute. But additional complexity (in the form of a second novel attribute) caused summarized and functional preferences to diverge, and biases emerged: Participants reported stronger summarized preferences for the attribute when the population of targets possessed more of the attribute on average (regardless of functional preference strength). We also documented some support for a standard-of-comparison mechanism to explain this inferential bias. These studies elucidate factors that may warp the translation process from people's experienced evaluative responses in the world to their overall, summary judgments about their attribute preferences.",2019-11-01,2020-02-06T01:55:12Z,2020-02-10T05:08:46Z,2020-02-06T01:55:12Z,103837,NA,85,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,NA,NA,en,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\SQKTXHU5\Eastwick et al. - 2019 - How do people translate their experiences into abs.pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\PDB28Z9M\S0022103118308114.html,NA,Attitudes; Attributes; Covariation detection; Mating; Preferences,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000983,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\SQKTXHU5\Eastwick et al. - 2019 - How do people translate their experiences into abs.pdf,TRUE

After-effects on pointing without feedback to a visual target (open loop pointing – OLP) are traditionally described as being larger than those measured by straight ahead pointing (SAP) with eyes closed, and the difference between them is attributed to a shift in visual localisation. However, neither differences between OLP and SAP, nor shifts in perceptual judgement of visual straight ahead (VSA), are consistently reported. Moreover, since very few studies have directly recorded direction of gaze, an effect of PA on the state estimate of gaze direction has not been reliably documented. The current research aimed to isolate the effects of PA on state estimates of eye position. We measured sensorimotor after-effects through common (OLP, SAP, and VSA) measures, and also recorded eye position and additional after-effect measures to interrogate changes to the oculomotor system and how these might relate to other measures of sensorimotor change. To ascertain if PA's effects on estimates of eye position could be attributed to eye muscle potentiation, we compared the effects of PA to sustained gaze deviation without adaptation. PA induced no effect on visual straight-ahead and no change in direction of gaze, when measured while positioning a target, looking straight ahead in the dark, or looking toward the passively positioned and occluded unexposed hand. We also found that after-effects measured by SAP with the eyes open were larger than SAP with the eyes closed and equal to those observed with OLP. The findings challenge the concept that total adaptation after-effect is a direct sum of arm proprioceptive and visual after-effects as conventionally measured, and suggest that the oculomotor system is altered by prism adaptation only in interaction with an arm motor command when vision is available.",2019-06-01,2020-01-30T06:59:54Z,2020-01-30T07:00:20Z,2020-01-30T06:59:53Z,246-263,NA,115,Cortex,NA,NA,en,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\UL8HJWNE\Gilligan et al. - 2019 - The effect of prism adaptation on state estimates .pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\7CV9SZEV\S0010945219300590.html,NA,Prism adaptation; Eye position; Proprioception; Visual shift,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000984,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\UL8HJWNE\Gilligan et al. - 2019 - The effect of prism adaptation on state estimates .pdf,TRUE

Therefore, alternative strategies, such as retrograde coronary venous infusion (RCVI), are explored. The aim of this confirmatory study was to compare cardiac cell retention between RCVI and IC infusion. As a secondary end point, the procedural safety of RCVI is assessed. Methods Four weeks after myocardial infarction, 12 pigs were randomised to receive mesenchymal stromal cells, labelled with Indium-111, via RCVI (n=6) or IC infusion (n=6). Four hours after cell administration, nuclear imaging was performed to determine the number of cells retained in the heart both in vivo and ex vivo. Procedure-related safety measures were reported. Results Cardiac cell retention is significantly lower after RCVI compared with IC infusion (in vivo: RCVI: median 2.89% vs IC: median 13.74%, p=0.002, ex vivo: RCVI: median 2.55% vs IC: median 39.40%, p=0.002). RCVI led to development of pericardial fluid and haematomas on the frontal wall of the heart in three cases. Coronary venous dissection after RCVI was seen in three pigs, of which one also developed pericardial fluid and a haematoma. IC infusion led to no flow in one pig. Conclusion RCVI is significantly less efficient in delivering cells to the heart compared with IC infusion. RCVI led to more procedure-related safety issues than IC infusion, with multiple cases of venous dissection and development of haematomas and pericardial fluid collections.",2019-01-01,2020-01-28T06:47:10Z,2020-01-28T06:47:40Z,2020-01-28T06:47:10Z,NA,1,3,NA,NA,NA,en,"© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

We tested children on a task that required perspective taking to interpret a speaker’s intended meaning. Monolingual children failed to interpret the speaker’s meaning dramatically more often than both bilingual children and children who were exposed to a multilingual environment but were not bilingual themselves. Children who were merely exposed to a second language performed as well as bilingual children, despite having lower executive-function scores.

The relationship between body-ownership and the sense of agency has been described by different neurocognitive models, each providing specific neurofunctional predictions. According to an “additive” model, the sense of agency entails body-ownership, while an alternative “independence” hypothesis suggests that they represent two qualitatively different processes, underpinned by distinct brain systems. We propose a third “interactive” model, arguing the interdependence between body-ownership and the sense of agency: these constructs might represent different experiences with specific and exclusive brain correlates, but they also could partly overlap at the neurofunctional level. Here we test these three neurocognitive models by reviewing the available neurofunctional literature of body-ownership and the sense of agency, with a quantitative meta-analytical approach that allowed us to compare their neural correlates statistically. We identified (i) a body-ownership-specific network including the left inferior parietal lobule and the left extra-striate body area, (ii) a sense-of-agency-specific network including the left SMA, the left posterior insula, the right postcentral gyrus, and the right superior temporal lobe and (iii) a shared network in the left middle insula. These results provide support for the interactive neurocognitive model of body-ownership and the sense of agency. Body-ownership involves a sensory network in which multisensory inputs are integrated to be self-attributed. On the other hand, the sense of agency is specifically associated with premotor and sensory-motor areas, typically involved in generating motor predictions and in action monitoring. Finally, body-ownership and the sense of agency interact at the level of the left middle insula, a high-level multisensory hub engaged in body and action awareness in general.",2019-12-01,2020-01-30T08:10:37Z,2020-01-30T12:01:54Z,2020-01-30T08:10:37Z,169-178,NA,121,Cortex,Neurofunctional correlates of body-ownership and sense of agency,NA,en,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\SP6BNGKP\Seghezzi et al. - 2019 - Neurofunctional correlates of body-ownership and s.pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\7HL8XVQM\S0010945219303077.html,NA,Meta-analysis; Motor control; Body-ownership; Self-awareness; Sense of agency,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000996,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\SP6BNGKP\Seghezzi et al. - 2019 - Neurofunctional correlates of body-ownership and s.pdf,TRUE

This misprediction was indeed mediated by anticipated distraction and was therefore attenuated after people were reminded of the absorbing nature of enjoyable activities (Studies 3 and 4).

This effect reverses at longer intervals, giving rise to Inhibition of Return (IOR). The integration-segregation hypothesis (Lupiáñez, 2010) suggests that peripheral cues always produce an onset-detection cost regardless the behavioral cueing effect that is measured – either facilitation or IOR. In the present study, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to investigate the causal contribution of this detection cost to performance. We used a cueing paradigm with a target discrimination task that was preceded by a non-informative peripheral cue. The presence-absence of a central intervening event was manipulated. Online TMS to the left superior parietal lobe (compared to an active vertex stimulation) lead to an overall more positive effect (faster responses for cued as compared to uncued trials), by putatively impairing the detection cost contribution to performance. The data revealed a strong association between overall RT and the TMS effect, and also between overall RT and the integrity of the first branch of the left superior longitudinal fascicule.

A growing body of evidence suggests that rhythmic neural activity in the alpha frequency band (8–12 Hz) tracks the spatial locus of covert attention, which suggests that alpha activity is integral to spatial attention. However, extant work has not provided a compelling test of another key prediction: that alpha activity tracks the temporal dynamics of covert spatial orienting. In the current study, we examined the time course of spatially specific alpha activity after central cues and during visual search. Critically, the time course of this activity tracked trial-by-trial variations in orienting latency during visual search.

Participants (46% male; mean age = 42 years, SD = 11) completed the 200?item HEXACO Personality Inventory?Revised either as part of a job application (n = 1613) or as part of low?stakes research (n = 1613). A comprehensive set of invariance tests were performed. Applicants scored higher than non?applicants on honesty?humility (d = 0.86), extraversion (d = 0.73), agreeableness (d = 1.06), and conscientiousness (d = 0.77). The bifactor model provided improved model fit relative to a standard correlated factor model, and loadings on the evaluative factor of the bifactor model were highly correlated with other indicators of item social desirability. The bifactor model explained approximately two?thirds of the differences between applicants and non?applicants. Results suggest that rather than being a higher order construct, the general factor of personality may be caused by an item?level evaluative process. Results highlight the importance of modelling data at the item?level. Implications for conceptualizing social desirability, higher order structures in personality, test development, and job applicant faking are discussed.

Results across two studies support prior findings regarding Solomon’s paradox: Participants (N = 623) more strongly endorsed wise-reasoning strategies (e.g., intellectual humility, adopting an outsider’s perspective) for resolving other people’s social conflicts than for resolving their own. The pursuit of virtue (e.g., pursuing personal ideals and contributing to other people) moderated this effect of conflict type. In both studies, greater endorsement of the pursuit of virtue was associated with greater endorsement of wise-reasoning strategies for one’s own personal conflicts; as a result, participants who highly endorsed the pursuit of virtue endorsed wise-reasoning strategies at similar levels for resolving their own social conflicts and resolving other people’s social conflicts.

How do such arrangements influence the linkage between public opinion and policy outputs? I argue that policymaking under territorial representation should be systematically skewed toward opinion in those states where citizens care about a policy issue and have a uniform view on it. This claim is tested using a novel data set of policy change in the European Union (EU), covering 211 policy issues and 6,506 observations of opinion–policy dyads. Results show that measures weighting opinion across member states by how much national citizens care about an issue are better predictors of policy change than EU-wide mean opinion. Moreover, congruence between state-level opinion and EU-level policy becomes more likely, the more salient and clear-cut opinion in a member state is.

Five studies examined implicit theories of interest—the idea that personal interests are relatively fixed (fixed theory) or developed (growth theory). Whether assessed or experimentally induced, a fixed theory was more likely to dampen interest in areas outside people’s existing interests (Studies 1–3). Individuals endorsing a fixed theory were also more likely to anticipate boundless motivation when passions were found, not anticipating possible difficulties (Study 4). Moreover, when it became difficult to engage in a new interest, interest flagged significantly more for people induced to hold a fixed rather than a growth theory of interest (Study 5).

In contrast, we found that providing affective forecasters with social-category information about their targets made their forecasts more extreme and therefore less accurate. In both political and sports contexts, forecasters across five experiments exhibited greater impact bias for both in-group and out-group members (e.g., a Democrat or Republican) than for unspecified targets when predicting experiencers’ responses to positive and negative events. Inducing time pressure reduced the extremity of forecasts for group-labeled but not unspecified targets, which suggests that the increased impact bias was due to overcorrection for social-category information, not different intuitive predictions for identified targets.

The violation of distributional assumptions can result in consequences ranging from small changes to error rates through to substantially biased estimates and parameters fundamentally losing their intended interpretations. Conventionally, researchers have conducted assumption checks after collecting data, and then changed the primary analysis technique if violations of distributional assumptions are observed. An approach to dealing with distributional assumptions that requires decisions to be made contingent on observed data is problematic, however, in preregisteredresearch, where researchers attempt to specify all important analysis decisions prior to collecting data. Limited methodological advice is currently available regarding how to deal with the prospect of distributional assumption violations in preregistered research. In this article, we examine several strategies that researchers could use in preregistrations to reduce the potential impact of distributional assumption violations. We suggest that pre-emptively selecting analysis methods that are as robust as possible to assumption violations, performing planned robustness analyses, and/or supplementing preregistered confirmatory analyses with exploratory checks of distributional assumptions may all be useful strategies. On the other hand, we suggest that prespecifying “decision trees” for selecting data analysis methods based on the distributional characteristics of the data may not be practical in most situations.",2019-09-12,2020-01-29T08:02:56Z,2020-01-29T08:03:13Z,2020-01-29T08:02:56Z,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,en,"Copyright (c) 2019 Matt N Williams, Casper Albers",open.lnu.se,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\5287VKPZ\Williams and Albers - 2019 - Dealing with Distributional Assumptions in Preregi.pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\J3NVKACI\1592.html,NA,open science; transparency; preregistrations; statistical assumptions,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001025,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\5287VKPZ\Williams and Albers - 2019 - Dealing with Distributional Assumptions in Preregi.pdf,TRUE

In the current study, we use a network science approach to examine if the organization of semantic memory differs between high and low groups of openness to experience. A sample of 516 adults completed measures of openness to experience (from the NEO Five-Factor Inventory-3 and Big Five Aspect Scales) and a semantic verbal fluency task. Next, the sample was split into half to form high (n = 258) and low (n = 258) openness to experience groups. Semantic networks were then constructed on the basis of their verbal fluency responses. Our results revealed that the high openness to experience group's network was more interconnected, flexible, and had better local organization of associations than the low openness to experience group. We also found that the high openness to experience group generated more responses on average and provided more unique responses than the low openness to experience group.

We provided evidence for the latter hypothesis using experiments that compared nonoverlapping groups of readers of two Indian languages (Telugu and Malayalam). Readers showed increased single-letter discrimination and decreased letter interactions for bigrams during visual search. Importantly, these interactions predicted subjects’ overall reading fluency. In a separate brain-imaging experiment, we observed increased compositionality in readers, whereby responses to bigrams were more predictable from single letters. This effect was specific to the anterior lateral occipital region, where activations best matched behavior.

This preregistered, direct replication attempt uses equivalence testing and the small telescopes framework from Simonsohn (2015) to argue that such an effect, if it exists, is too small to have been reliably detected under the original design.

However, it also can be stressful, and when parents lack the resources needed to handle stressors related to parenting, they may develop parental burnout. This condition is characterized by an overwhelming exhaustion related to one’s parental role, an emotional distancing from one’s children, and a sense of parental ineffectiveness. Researchers have begun to document the antecedents of parental burnout, but little is known about its consequences. Here we investigated the impact of parental burnout on escape ideation, parental neglect, and parental violence through two cross-lagged longitudinal studies (N = 918, N = 822) that involved the completion of online surveys three times over a year. Results indicated that parental burnout strongly increases escape ideation as well as neglectful and violent behaviors toward one’s children (aggregated Cohen’s d = 1.31, 1.25, and 1.25, respectively).

For example, in recent decades, policy statements related to media effects have been released with increasing regularity. However, they have often provoked criticisms that they do not adequately reflect the state of the science on media effects. The News Media, Public Education and Public Policy Committee (a standing committee of APA’s Division 46, the Media Psychology and Technology division) reviewed all publicly available policy statements on media effects produced by professional organizations and evaluated them using a standardized rubric. It was found that current policy statements tend to be more definitive than is warranted by the underlying science, and often ignore conflicting research results. These findings have broad implications for policy statements more generally, outside the field of media effects. In general, the committee suggests that professional organizations run the risk of misinforming the public when they release policy statements that do not acknowledge debates and inconsistencies in a field, or limitations of methodology.

Determining whether this process is characterized by tonotopic maps in primary or secondary auditory areas, with bilateral or leftward activity, remains a long-standing challenge. Magnetoencephalographic studies failed to show hierarchical and asymmetric hints for speech processing. We employed high-density electroencephalography to map the Salento Italian vowel system onto cortical sources using the N1 auditory evoked component. We found evidence that the N1 is characterized by hierarchical and asymmetrical indexes in primary and secondary auditory areas structuring vowel representations. Importantly, the N1 was characterized by early and late phases. The early N1 peaked at 125–135 msec and was localized in the primary auditory cortex; the late N1 peaked at 145–155 msec and was localized in the left superior temporal gyrus. We showed that early in the primary auditory cortex, the cortical spatial arrangements—along the lateral-medial and anterior-posterior gradients—are broadly warped by phonemotopic patterns according to the distinctive feature principle. These phonemotopic patterns are carefully refined in the superior temporal gyrus along the inferior-superior and anterior-posterior gradients.

To address this question, we used a dual-task paradigm: Participants prepared an action (e.g., grasping), while concurrently performing an orientation-change-detection task.

In this article, we quantify this tendency using information-theoretic measures and report on a study in which we tested the counterintuitive prediction that children will produce words that have a low frequency given the context, because these will be most informative. Using corpora of child-directed speech, we identified adjectives that varied in how informative (i.e., unexpected) they were given the noun they modified. In an initial experiment (N = 31) and in a replication (N = 13), 3-year-olds heard an experimenter use these adjectives to describe pictures. The children’s task was then to describe the pictures to another person. As the information content of the experimenter’s adjective increased, so did children’s tendency to comment on the feature that adjective had encoded.

The credibility makes it possible for the speaker to be viewed as open-minded, which subsequently inspires greater hope. This process culminates in an increased openness to the outgroup. These findings have been restricted to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but here we examine their generalizability to racial conflict in the United States.

We show that participants criticized the morality and intellect of someone else who made a Bayesian judgment, shared less money with this person, and incurred financial costs to punish this person. However, participants made unequal judgments as a Bayesian statistician would, thereby rendering the same judgment that they found repugnant when offered by someone else. This inconsistency, which can be reconciled by differences in which base rate is attended to, suggests that participants use group membership in a way that reflects the savvy of a Bayesian and the disrepute of someone they consider to be a bigot.",2019-01,2019-04-06T18:41:43Z,2019-04-06T18:42:01Z,2019-04-06T18:41:43Z,20-31,1,30,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,Crossref,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\PNU6VFIT\Cao e.a. - 2019 - People Make the Same Bayesian Judgment They Critic.pdf,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001056,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\PNU6VFIT\Cao e.a. - 2019 - People Make the Same Bayesian Judgment They Critic.pdf,TRUE

Despite advances in treatments that slow progression and minimize locomotor impairments, its clinical management is still a challenge. Previous preclinical studies, using mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation and isolated physical exercise (EX), reported beneficial results for treatment of PD. Therefore, this experimental randomized study aimed to elucidate the therapeutic potential of combined therapy using adipose-derived human MSCs (ADSCs) grafted into the striatum in conjunction with aerobic treadmill training, specifically in terms of locomotor performance in a unilateral PD rat model induced by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). Forty-one male Wistar rats were categorized into five groups in accordance with the type of treatment to which they were subjected (Sham, 6-OHDA − injury, 6-OHDA + exercise, 6-OHDA + cells, and 6-OHDA + combined). Subsequently, dopaminergic depletion was assessed by the methylphenidate challenge and the specified therapeutic intervention was conducted in each group. The foot fault task was performed at the end of the experiment to serve as an assessment of motor skills. The results showed that despite disturbances in motor balance and coordination, locomotor dysfunction was ameliorated in all treatment categories in comparison to the injury group (sign test, p < 0.001, effect size: 0.71). The exercise alone and combined groups were the categories that exhibited the best recovery in terms of movement performance (p < 0.001). Overall, this study confirms that exercise is a powerful option to improve motor function and a promising adjuvant intervention for stem cell transplantation in the treatment of PD motor symptoms.

Using a sample of 404 healthy adults, we examined the roles of perceived social support and received hugs in buffering against interpersonal stress-induced susceptibility to infectious disease. Perceived support was assessed by questionnaire, and daily interpersonal conflict and receipt of hugs were assessed by telephone interviews on 14 consecutive evenings. Subsequently, participants were exposed to a virus that causes a common cold and were monitored in quarantine to assess infection and illness signs. Perceived support protected against the rise in infection risk associated with increasing frequency of conflict. A similar stress-buffering effect emerged for hugging, which explained 32% of the attenuating effect of support. Among infected participants, greater perceived support and more-frequent hugs each predicted less-severe illness signs.

The AD group generated fewer self-images and memories compared to controls, but demonstrated similar temporal organization of self-cued memories. In both groups, self-images were supported by semantic memories that were temporally clustered around times of identity-formation. These self-supporting memories are proposed to form a scaffold to support the self and may persist the longest in AD, as opposed to memories from early adulthood per se. In both AD and control groups, self-images cued more semantic memories than non-self-relevant cues, further suggesting that semantic autobiographical memories play a fundamental role in supporting the self. These findings demonstrate that the self remains largely intact in AD, in spite of severe episodic memory deficits and global cognitive decline.

In four studies (total N = 2086), we investigated preferences for consequentialist vs. non-consequentialist social partners endorsing instrumental harm or impartial beneficence and examined how such preferences varied across different types of social relationships. Our results demonstrate robust preferences for non-consequentialist over consequentialist agents in the domain of instrumental harm, and weaker – but still evident – preferences in the domain of impartial beneficence. In the domain of instrumental harm, non-consequentialist agents were consistently viewed as more moral and trustworthy, preferred for a range of social roles, and entrusted with more money in economic exchanges. In the domain of impartial beneficence, preferences for non-consequentialist agents were observed for close interpersonal relationships requiring direct interaction (friend, spouse) but not for more distant roles with little-to-no personal interaction (political leader).

In the current study, we investigated two opposing hypotheses: (a) that WM stores the interactions individually (the individual-storage hypothesis) and (b) that WM stores the interactions as chunks (the chunk-storage hypothesis). We required participants to memorize a set of individual actions while ignoring the underlying social interactions. We found that although the social-interaction aspect was task irrelevant, the interactive actions were stored in WM as chunks that were not affected by memory load (Experiments 1 and 2); however, inverting the human actions vertically abolished this chunking effect (Experiment 3).

Individual differences in perception should therefore be jointly determined by a person’s sensitivity to incoming evidence and his or her prior expectations. It has been proposed that individuals with autism have flatter prior distributions than do nonautistic individuals, which suggests that prior variance is linked to the degree of autistic traits in the general population. We tested this idea by studying how perceived speed changes during pursuit eye movement and at low contrast. We found that individual differences in these two motion phenomena were predicted by differences in thresholds and autistic traits when combined in a quantitative Bayesian model. Our findings therefore support the flatter-prior hypothesis and suggest that individual differences in prior expectations are more systematic than previously thought.

We investigated whether these relational costs might be offset by status benefits, and the processes underlying such benefits. Across eight experiments (N = 1456), we found that winners who expressed positive emotion were perceived as higher in social standing than winners who suppressed positive emotion. To understand the mechanisms underlying this effect, we manipulated factors to do with the situation in which emotion was expressed, the type of person expressing emotion, and the way emotion was expressed.

It is a constellation of two (Sentinel-1 A and B) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellites. The SAR wave mode (WV) routinely collects high-resolution SAR images of the ocean surface during day and night and through clouds. In this study, a subset of more than 37,000 SAR images is labelled corresponding to ten geophysical phenomena, including both oceanic and meteorologic features. These images cover the entire open ocean and are manually selected from Sentinel-1A WV acquisitions in 2016. For each image, only one prevalent geophysical phenomenon with its prescribed signature and texture is selected for labelling. The SAR images are processed into a quick-look image provided in the formats of PNG and GeoTIFF as well as the associated labels. They are convenient for both visual inspection and machine learning-based methods exploitation. The proposed dataset is the first one involving different oceanic or atmospheric phenomena over the open ocean. It seeks to foster the development of strategies or approaches for massive ocean SAR image analysis. A key objective was to allow exploiting the full potential of Sentinel-1 WV SAR acquisitions, which are about 60,000 images per satellite per month and freely available.

Aftereffects of suppression on automatic memory processes were measured in an autobiographical Implicit Association Test. Results showed that suppression attenuated brain-wave activity (the P300) associated with crime-relevant memory retrieval, which rendered waveforms from innocent and guilty participants indistinguishable. However, the two groups could nevertheless be discriminated via the late-posterior-negative slow wave, which may reflect the need to monitor response conflict arising between voluntary suppression and automatic recognition processes.

To overcome this problem, we developed and validated a unitary taxonomy of social power motives based on established delineations of social hierarchies: the dominance, prestige, and leadership account. While we could measure these motives both reliably and distinctively (study 1), we also showed they strongly related to a common power desire (study 2). Assessing their nomological networks (studies 3 and 4), we demonstrated distinct associations between the dominance motive (D: wanting to coerce others into adhering to one's will) and anger and verbal aggression; the prestige motive (P: wanting to obtain admiration and respect) and the fear of losing reputation and claiming to have higher moral concerns; the leadership motive (L: wanting to take responsibility in and for one's group) and emotional stability and helping behaviour. Furthermore, while D uniquely predicted agonistic/retaliatory behaviour in dictator games (study 5), L uniquely predicted the attainment of higher employment ranks in various professions (study 7). Finally, at least to some degree, P and L related positively, and D negatively to prosocial donating behaviour (study 6).

Moreover, most executive function models put under test until now are brain-free models: they are defined and discussed without assumptions regarding the neural bases of executive functions. By using a latent variable approach, here we tested a brain-centered model of executive function organization proposing that two distinct domain-general executive functions, namely, criterion setting and monitoring, may be dissociable both functionally and anatomically, with a left versus right hemispheric preference of prefrontal cortex and related neural networks, respectively. To this end, we tested a sample of healthy participants on a battery of computerized tasks assessing criterion setting and monitoring processes and involving diverse task domains, including the verbal and visuospatial ones, which are well-known to be lateralized. By doing this, we were able to specifically assess the influence of these task domains on the organization of executive functions and to directly contrast a process-based model of EF organization versus both a purely domain-based model and a process-based, but domain-dependent one. The results of confirmatory factor analyses showed that a purely process-based model reliably provided a better fit to the observed data as compared to alternative models, supporting the specific theoretical model that fractionates a subset of executive functions into criterion setting and monitoring with hemispheric specializations emerging regardless of the task domain.",2019-10-01,2020-01-30T07:36:24Z,2020-01-30T07:40:29Z,2020-01-30T07:36:24Z,441-456,NA,119,Cortex,Neuro-cognitive architecture of executive functions,NA,en,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\BSU4TNXT\Ambrosini et al. - 2019 - Neuro-cognitive architecture of executive function.pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\4TB22C7L\S0010945219302813.html,NA,Executive functions; Factor analysis; Hemispheric specialization; Latent variable analysis; Monitoring; Task-setting,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001091,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\BSU4TNXT\Ambrosini et al. - 2019 - Neuro-cognitive architecture of executive function.pdf,TRUE

However, the extent of voluntary control over which features of an attended multi-feature object are encoded and maintained in WM is debated. Some evidence suggests that attending to an object leads to obligatory storage of all of its features, whereas other evidence suggests that access to WM can be restricted to only goal-relevant features. Another possibility is that all features are initially encoded, but irrelevant features are removed from WM over time. To address these various possibilities, we used pattern classification of EEG signals to track the temporal evolution of representations reflecting the encoding and storage of task-relevant and irrelevant features in WM. In different blocks, participants remembered the orientation, color or both orientation and color of a colored, oriented grating. The color and orientation of the grating was randomly drawn from two distinct feature bins on each trial. To examine trial-specific activity reflecting storage of the object's features, a support vector machine (SVM) classifier was trained to classify what bin the stimulus features came from. Importantly, for orientation, the classifier produced reliably above-chance classification across the delay when orientation was task-relevant but not when it was task-irrelevant. Interestingly, orientation could be accurately classified on trials for which both orientation and color were remembered. Moreover, a separate measure corresponding to the probability of a feature belonging to the correct bin was significantly higher when orientation was task-relevant compared to task-irrelevant during encoding. Above-chance classification for color was only present during the initial 500 msec across all conditions. Our results suggest that although information about all of an object's features is present in the initial stimulus-evoked neural response, information about the task-irrelevant features is attenuated during stimulus encoding and is largely absent throughout the delay.",2019-02-01,2019-03-29T09:18:48Z,2019-03-29T09:19:47Z,2019-03-29T09:18:48Z,196-209,NA,111,Cortex,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\IQ4U3P3Q\Bocincova and Johnson - 2019 - The time course of encoding and maintenance of tas.pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\8469G9EP\S0010945218303460.html,NA,Feature binding; Support-vector machine classifier; Top-down control; Working memory,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001093,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\IQ4U3P3Q\Bocincova and Johnson - 2019 - The time course of encoding and maintenance of tas.pdf,TRUE

However, this “ego-quieting” effect contradicts an apparent psychological universal, the self-centrality principle. According to this principle, practicing any skill renders that skill self-central, and self-centrality breeds self-enhancement bias. We examined those opposing predictions in the first tests of mind-body practices’ self-enhancement effects. In Experiment 1, we followed 93 yoga students over 15 weeks, assessing self-centrality and self-enhancement bias after yoga practice (yoga condition, n = 246) and without practice (control condition, n = 231). In Experiment 2, we followed 162 meditators over 4 weeks (meditation condition: n = 246; control condition: n = 245). Self-enhancement bias was higher in the yoga (Experiment 1) and meditation (Experiment 2) conditions, and those effects were mediated by greater self-centrality.

This intervention is based on the premise that unintentional bias is like a habit that can be broken with sufficient motivation, awareness, and effort. We conducted replication of the original habit-breaking intervention experiment in a sample more than three times the size of the original (N=292). We also measured all outcomes every other day for 14days and measured potential mechanisms for the intervention's effects. Consistent with previous results, the habit-breaking intervention produced a change in concern that endured two weeks post-intervention. These effects were associated with increased sensitivity to the biases of others and an increased tendency to label biases as wrong. Contrasting with the original work, both control and intervention participants decreased in implicit bias, and the effects of the habit-breaking intervention on awareness declined in the second week of the study. In a subsample recruited two years later, intervention participants were more likely than control participants to object on a public online forum to an essay endorsing racial stereotyping.

We argue that such intergroup biases may result from an interaction of basic cognitive processes and the structure of the information ecology. This cognitiveecological model assumes that groups such as minorities and out-groups are often novel to a perceiver. At the level of cognition, novel groups are primarily associated with their unique attributes, that is, attributes that differentiate them from other groups. In the information ecology, however, unique attributes are likely to be negative. Thus, novel groups, and by proxy minorities and out-groups, tend to be associated with negative attributes, leading to an evaluative disadvantage. We demonstrated this disadvantage in three experiments in which participants successively formed impressions about two fictional groups associated with the same number of positive and negative attributes.

To arrive at a conclusion, people may gather further information, thereby running the risk of prolonging or blocking the decision-making process or even making suboptimal decisions. Here, we suggest that random decision aids may prove fruitful by reducing the need for further information. Five experiments (total N = 997) examined how information need is influenced after making a preliminary decision between two options and then receiving a suggestion from a random decision aid (a coin flip). Across studies, coin participants are less likely to request additional information (Study 1 and two follow-up studies, combined p = .021) and indicate a lower need for additional information (Study 2, p = .023, and Study 3, p = .001) compared to a control condition without a coin flip. Interestingly, participants do not necessarily adhere to the coin but stick to their preliminary decision as much as or even more than the control group, suggesting that the decision aid does not determine the decision outcome. This is true for hypothetical decisions between changing versus maintaining the status quo without an objectively correct solution (Studies 1, 1b, and 1c), for a decision between two options with an objectively correct solution (Study 2), and for a real monetary decision without an objectively correct solution (Study 3).

One such way, I show, is through the selective attribution of credit and blame. With four randomized experiments, conducted in diverse national settings and containing closed- as well as open-ended questions, I find that as partisans correctly updated economic beliefs to reflect new facts, they conversely attributed responsibility in a highly selective fashion.

Although generalisation in property induction and predictive learning tasks share conceptual similarities, it is unknown whether this diversity principle applies to generalisation of a predictive association. We tested this hypothesis in two predictive learning experiments using differential training where one category of stimuli (e.g., fruits) predicted an outcome and another category (e.g., vegetables) predicted no outcome. We compared generalisation between a Non-Diverse group who were presented with non-diverse evidence in both positive (predicted the outcome) and negative (predicted no outcome) categories, and two groups who received the same training as the Non-Diverse group but with a more diverse range of exemplars in the positive (Diverse+ group) or negative (Diverse– group) category. Diversity effects were found for both positive and negative categories, in that learning about a diverse range of exemplars increased generalisation of a predictive association to novel exemplars from that same category.

The results were largely consistent with the DynaMoS model: (1) individuals with a strong dispositional implicit communion motive reported more often to be in a communal motivational state; (2) communally motivated individuals were more likely to engage in subsequent instrumental behaviour; and (3) relationship experiences that potentially satisfy communion motivation led to more positive relationship outcomes when individuals were motivated before compared with when they were not. It is discussed how these results and the experience sampling method can foster our understanding of how dispositional characteristics translate into everyday processes and shape relationship outcomes.

In a single experiment (N = 8,925), we compared three fair-lineup techniques used by the police with unfair lineups in which we did nothing to prevent distinctive suspects from standing out. Compared with the fair lineups, doing nothing not only increased subjects’ willingness to identify the suspect but also markedly impaired subjects’ ability to distinguish between innocent and guilty suspects.

The relationship with changes in individualism was less robust for urbanization.

We find that the association between parents' attitudes, social norms, and perceived behavioral control and their adolescent's eating behavior tends to be stronger when parents have an authoritative parenting style.

Participants were randomly assigned to either a production- or a comprehension-learning condition, with conditions designed to balance attention demands and other known production–comprehension differences. After training, production-learning participants outperformed comprehension-learning participants on vocabulary comprehension and on comprehension tests of grammatical dependencies, even when we controlled for individual differences in vocabulary learning.

We propose that one mechanism by which women harm rivals' social opportunities is through selectively transmitting reputation-relevant social information. Moreover, we contend that this behavior is designed to undermine the romantic and social appeal of same-sex romantic rivals who are perceived to be threatening. Evidence from five studies suggests that women's dissemination of social information is strategic and reliably predicted by various cues of romantic rival threat: attempts at mate poaching (Study 1), physical attractiveness (Studies 2 and 3), and provocative clothing (Studies 4 and 5). Women strategically harmed and failed to enhance the reputations of other women who threatened their romantic prospects directly (by flirting with their romantic partners) and indirectly (by being attractive or provocatively dressed). Women's dispositional levels of competitiveness also predicted their information transmission: highly competitive women (both generally and in romantic domains specifically) disclosed more reputation-damaging information than did less competitive women. Furthermore, women transmitted reputation-harming information about female targets independent of how much they explicitly liked those targets, suggesting a disconnect between women's intentions and their gossip behavior. Irrespective of the gossiper's intentions, pilot data confirmed that social harm is likely to befall the women targeted by the transmission of reputation-damaging social information.",2018-09-01,2019-03-30T16:43:21Z,2019-03-30T16:43:35Z,2019-03-30T16:43:21Z,195-209,NA,78,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,Competitive reputation manipulation,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\3IZGA68V\Reynolds e.a. - 2018 - Competitive reputation manipulation Women strateg.pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\KI9GG4T5\S0022103117304195.html,NA,Competitiveness; Gossip; Indirect aggression; Intrasexual competition; Reputation,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,2018,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001125,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\3IZGA68V\Reynolds e.a. - 2018 - Competitive reputation manipulation Women strateg.pdf,TRUE

Do these benefits disqualify prosocial acts from being truly altruistic? Scientists and philosophers have long debated this question, but few have considered laypeople's beliefs about altruism. Here, we examine such lay theories surrounding altruism. Across two studies, observers read about agents who behaved prosocially. In some cases, agents benefitted materially, socially, or emotionally from their actions (self-oriented consequences); in other cases, they acted in order to accrue these benefits (self-oriented motives). Observers “penalized” actions that produced self-oriented consequences – rating them as less altruistic than actions involving no such benefit – unless these benefits were emotional. When agents' actions involved self-oriented motives, observers penalized them more harshly, viewing their behavior as more selfish than even clearly non-prosocial acts. These data suggest that lay theories distinguish between motives for, and “side effects” of, prosocial actions, converging with recent psychological theories of altruism.",2018-03-01,2018-04-05T06:58:57Z,2018-04-05T06:59:06Z,2018-04-05T06:58:57Z,36-40,NA,75,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,Good deeds gone bad,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\TD26CICQ\Carlson and Zaki - 2018 - Good deeds gone bad Lay theories of altruism and .pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\YB2XZFTM\S0022103117301701.html,NA,Lay theories; Altruism; Attribution; Emotion; Selfishness,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2018,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001131,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\TD26CICQ\Carlson and Zaki - 2018 - Good deeds gone bad Lay theories of altruism and .pdf,TRUE

Most importantly, we focused on compensatory balance reactions where the arms were required to regain stability following unexpected postural perturbation. Our first question was if motor cortical activity from the hand area automatically corresponds to the visual environment. Affordance-based priming of the motor system was assessed using single-pulse Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) to determine if visual access to a wall-mounted support handle influenced corticospinal excitability. We evaluated if hand actions were automatically facilitated and/or suppressed by viewing an available handle within graspable range. Our second question was if the requirement for rapid movement to recover balance played a role in modulating any affordance effect in the hands. The goal was to disentangle motor demands related to postural threat from the impact of observation alone. For balance trials, a custom-built, lean and release apparatus was used to impose temporally unpredictable postural perturbations. In all balance trials, perturbations were of sufficient magnitude to evoke a compensatory change-in-support response; therefore, any recovery action needed to carefully take into account the affordances and constraints of the perceived environment to prevent a fall. Consistent with our first hypothesis, activity in an intrinsic hand muscle was increased when participants passively viewed a wall-mounted safety handle, in both seated and standing contexts. Contrary to our second hypothesis, this visual priming was absent when perturbations were imposed and the handle was needed to regain balance. Our results reveal that motor set is influenced by simply viewing objects that afford a grasp. We suggest that such preparation may provide an advantage when generating balance recovery actions that require quickly grasping a supportive handle. This priming effect likely competes with other task-dependent influences that regulate cortical motor output. Future studies should expand from limitations inherent with single-pulse TMS alone, to determine if vision of our surrounding world influences motor set in other contexts (e.g., intensified postural threat) and investigate if this priming corresponds to overt behavior.",2019-08-01,2020-01-30T07:20:15Z,2020-01-30T07:20:36Z,2020-01-30T07:20:15Z,135-146,NA,117,Cortex,NA,NA,en,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\TTD2AL7W\Bolton et al. - 2019 - Motor preparation for compensatory reach-to-grasp .pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\ZBXH42YU\S0010945219301030.html,NA,Transcranial magnetic stimulation; Affordance; Anticipatory set; Corticospinal excitability; Reactive balance,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001132,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\TTD2AL7W\Bolton et al. - 2019 - Motor preparation for compensatory reach-to-grasp .pdf,TRUE

While such distraction is typically regarded as potentially important in everyday life, previous work has so far not examined how deviant sounds affect performance on more complex daily tasks. In this study, we developed a new method to examine whether deviant sounds can disrupt reading performance by recording participants’ eye movements. Participants read single sentences in silence and while listening to task-irrelevant sounds. In the latter condition, a 50-ms sound was played contingent on the fixation of five target words in the sentence. On most occasions, the same tone was presented (standard sound), whereas on rare and unexpected occasions it was replaced by white noise (deviant sound). The deviant sound resulted in significantly longer fixation durations on the target words relative to the standard sound. A time-course analysis showed that the deviant sound began to affect fixation durations around 180 ms after fixation onset. Furthermore, deviance distraction was not modulated by the lexical frequency of target words. In summary, fixation durations on the target words were longer immediately after the presentation of the deviant sound, but there was no evidence that it interfered with the lexical processing of these words. The present results are in line with the recent proposition that deviant sounds yield a temporary motor suppression and suggest that deviant sounds likely inhibit the programming of the next saccade.",2019-07-01,2020-02-05T06:10:41Z,2020-02-05T06:10:58Z,2020-02-05T06:10:41Z,1863-1875,7,72,Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology,Distraction by deviant sounds during reading,NA,en,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\NW3XHCJK\Vasilev et al. - 2019 - Distraction by deviant sounds during reading An e.pdf,NA,NA,reading; auditory distractors; Deviance distraction; eye-movements,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001134,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\NW3XHCJK\Vasilev et al. - 2019 - Distraction by deviant sounds during reading An e.pdf,TRUE

First, we tested a new approach to affect regulation dynamics, conceptualized as a network made up of the reciprocal influences that affect and affect regulation strategies constantly exert on each other. Second, we attempted to gain a better understanding of these dynamics by examining how they vary according to broad personality traits. To this end, we adopted an experience sampling method, involving five daily assessments over a 2?week period. In each assessment, participants indicated their current affective experience and the way they had implemented five well?known affect regulation strategies (i.e. appreciation, positive reappraisal, distraction, expressive suppression, and rumination) since the previous assessment. At the sample level, the network of affect regulation dynamics was characterized by positive feedback loops between positive affect and so?called broad?minded strategies, and between negative affect and narrow?minded strategies. The form of this network varied according to levels of extraversion and neuroticism. Our findings are discussed in light of current knowledge about personality and affect regulation.

Similar patterns were observed in a free-choice task (Study 1) and when the favorableness of options was manipulated (Study 2).

However, the series of studies reported here shows that there is no dedicated category for reasoning about out-groups in terms of pathogens. Specifically, a memory-confusion experiment conducted with two large-scale samples of Americans (one nationally representative) yielded strong, replicable evidence that healthy out-group members are represented using the same psychological category that is used to represent manifestly infected in-group members.

Noting the role of the gut microbiome in host physiology like nutrition and health, it is thus essential to understand how human–wildlife interactions and availability of anthropogenic food in habitats can affect an animal's gut microbiome. This study, therefore, set out to examine the gut microbiota of Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) with varying accessibility to anthropogenic food and the possibility of using gut microbiota as indicator for macaques’ reliance on anthropogenic food. Using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing, we described the microbial composition of Japanese macaques experiencing different types of human disturbance and anthropogenic food availability—captive, provisioned, crop-raiding, and wild. In terms of alpha diversity, our results showed that observed richness of gut microbiota did not differ significantly between disturbance types but among collection sites, whereas Shannon diversity index differed by both disturbance types and sites. In terms of beta diversity, captive populations harbored the most distinctive gut microbial composition, and had the greatest difference compared with wild populations. Whereas for provisioned and crop-raiding groups, the macaques exhibited intermediate microbiota between wild and captive. We identified several potential bacterial taxa at different taxonomic ranks whose abundance potentially could help in assessing macaques’ accessibility to anthropogenic food.

Here we investigate whether a positive bias that operates at the individual-level, belief in a good true self, may be leveraged to reduce intergroup bias. We find that even stereotypically threatening out-group agents are believed to have a good true self (Experiment 1). More importantly, consideration of an in-group and out-group members' true self reduces intergroup bias, both in the form of explicit evaluative judgments (Experiment 2) and actual donation behavior (Experiment 3). Across studies, the palliative effects of thinking of an individual's true self generalize to that individual's entire group. In sum, a simple intervention — thinking about another's true self — reduces the gap in how people evaluate and treat out-group relative to in-group members. We discuss implications of these findings for conflict reduction strategies.",2018-01-01,2018-04-05T23:59:49Z,2018-04-06T00:00:10Z,2018-04-05T23:59:49Z,307-316,NA,74,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,Deep down my enemy is good,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\JXUFGLLE\De Freitas and Cikara - 2018 - Deep down my enemy is good Thinking about the tru.pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\EVXPY8AL\S0022103116307223.html,NA,Lay theories; Essentialism; Intergroup bias; True self,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2018,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001150,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\JXUFGLLE\De Freitas and Cikara - 2018 - Deep down my enemy is good Thinking about the tru.pdf,TRUE

This assumption is that multimodal integration requires consciousness; however, few studies have explicitly tested if integration can occur between nonconscious information from different modalities. The proposed study examined whether a classic indicator of multimodal integration – the McGurk effect – can be elicited with subliminal auditory–visual speech stimuli. We used a masked speech priming paradigm developed by Kouider and Dupoux (2005) in conjunction with continuous flash suppression (CFS; Tsuchiya & Koch, 2005), a binocular rivalry technique for presenting video stimuli subliminally. Applying these techniques together, we carried out two experiments in which participants categorised auditory syllable targets which were preceded by subliminal auditory–visual (AV) speech primes. Subliminal AV primes were either illusion-inducing (McGurk) or illusion-neutral (Incongruent) combinations of speech stimuli. In Experiment 1, the categorisation of the syllable target (“pa”) was facilitated by the same syllable prime when it was part of a McGurk combination (auditory “pa” and visual “ka”) but not when part of an Incongruent combination (auditory “pa” and visual “wa”). This dependency on specific AV combinations indicated a nonconscious AV interaction. Experiment 2 presented a different syllable target (“ta”) which matched the predicted illusory outcome of the McGurk combination – here, both the McGurk combination (auditory “pa” and visual “ka”) and the Incongruent combination (auditory “ta” and visual “ka”) failed to facilitate target categorisation. The combined results of both Experiments demonstrate a type of nonconscious multimodal interaction that is distinct from integration – it allows unimodal information that is compatible for integration (i.e., McGurk combinations) to persist and influence later processes, but does not actually combine and alter that information. As the GWS model does not account for non-integrative multimodal interactions, this places some pressure on such models of consciousness.",2019-08-01,2020-01-30T07:19:43Z,2020-01-30T07:20:07Z,2020-01-30T07:19:42Z,1-15,NA,117,Cortex,NA,NA,en,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\FJW3IGYY\Ching et al. - 2019 - Auditory–visual integration during nonconscious pe.pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\WZVAT52H\S0010945219300668.html,NA,Priming; Consciousness; Multimodal integration; Subliminal,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001152,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\FJW3IGYY\Ching et al. - 2019 - Auditory–visual integration during nonconscious pe.pdf,TRUE

This article reports a preregistered large-scale attempt to replicate four influential anticipatory-looking implicit theory-of-mind tasks using original stimuli and procedures. Results showed that only one of the four paradigms was reliably replicated. A second set of studies revealed, further, that this one paradigm was no longer replicated once confounds were removed, which calls its validity into question.

We then tested the infants’ selective attention to two novel individuals after one sang the familiar song and the other sang the unfamiliar song. Infants who had experienced a parent singing looked longer at the new person who had sung the familiar melody than at the new person who had sung the unfamiliar melody, and the amount of song exposure at home predicted the size of that preference. Neither effect was observed, however, among infants who had heard the song emanating from a toy or being sung by a socially unrelated person, despite these infants’ remarkable memory for the familiar melody, tested an average of more than 8 months later.

Translational value of preclinical studies may be improved by appraisal of the quality of experimental design and risk of biases, which remains to be addressed for FST. The present protocol of a systematic review with meta-analysis aims to investigate the quality of preclinical studies employing FST to identify risks of bias in future publications. In addition, this protocol will help to determine the effect sizes (ES) for primary and secondary outcomes according to several aspects of the FST study design. Search strategy, Screening annotation, Data management Publications reporting studies testing different classes of antidepressants in FST will be collected from Medline, SCOPUS and Web of Science databases. A broad list of inclusion criteria will be applied excluding those studies whereby FST is used as a stressor or studies reporting data from co-treatments. For assessing the quality of the included publications, the quality checklist adapted by Collaborative Approach to Meta-Analysis and Review of Animal Data from Experimental Studies will be used. If the meta-analysis seems feasible, the ES and the 95% CI will be analysed. The heterogeneity between studies will be assessed by using the χ2statistic with n−1 degrees of freedom. Subgroup meta-analysis (meta-regression, and if necessary, stratified regression) will be performed when possible according to characteristics of study design and study quality to assess their impact on efficacy of the treatments. In addition, funnel plotting, Egger regression, and ‘trim and fill’ will be used to assess the risk of publication bias. Results of this protocol will help to create rational methodological guidelines for application of FST in rodents and improve the quality and translational value of preclinical research on antidepressant discovery. Reporting A preliminary version of the present protocol has been preregistered with Systematic Review Facility (http://syrf.org.uk/). A preprint version of the current protocol has been registered with Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/9kxm4/). Results will be communicated in scientific meetings and peer-reviewed journals. We plan to conduct an anonymous and online survey within the scientific community to ask researchers about their perception of risk of bias and their experience with the publication of negative results.",2019-05-01,2020-01-28T06:48:51Z,2020-01-28T06:49:09Z,2020-01-28T06:48:51Z,NA,1,3,NA,Protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis of data from preclinical studies employing forced swimming test,NA,en,"© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Subjects first learned about an altruistic dictator, who subsequently made altruistic splits collectively with a partner. Results revealed that because the presence of the dictator already predicted the outcome, subjects did not learn to associate value with the partner. This social blocking effect was not observed in the loss domain: A kind robber’s partner, who could steal all the subjects’ money but stole little, acquired highly positive value—which biased subjects’ subsequent behavior.

However, emerging work now shows that individuals' brain responses can vary systematically in both the size and type of effect elicited. The present research therefore examined individual differences in neural activity elicited by grammatical agreement anomalies during language comprehension in a large cohort of highly literate, monolingual English speakers (N = 114), a population generally assumed to be relatively homogenous in terms of linguistic knowledge and processing. Results showed systematic variability in event-related brain potentials (ERPs) elicited by subject-verb agreement anomalies, with brain responses varying on a continuum between N400 and P600 dominant responses. Similar variation was found both when agreement was realized via inflectional morphology or via lexical alternations. Individuals' brain response type correlated strongly across these two conditions. Similar variation was also found for ERPs elicited during rapid serial visual presentation and when self-paced ERPs were recorded. Multilevel latent variable regression showed that variation in brain response amplitude and type was not related to individual differences in language experience or verbal working memory capacity, despite high statistical power. These findings indicate that descriptions of processing dynamics predicated solely on grand mean analyses of central tendency can fail to provide an accurate, generalizable account of how processing unfolds in many or most individual members of the population studied. Furthermore, these findings show that systematic individual variation in engagement of neural system supporting grammatical processing is found even in language users at the highest end of the proficiency spectrum and in grammatically simple sentences. This study therefore has implications for studies of language processing in atypical populations.",2019-02-01,2020-02-07T06:19:54Z,2020-02-07T06:20:31Z,2020-02-07T06:19:54Z,210-237,NA,111,Cortex,Robust neurocognitive individual differences in grammatical agreement processing,NA,en,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\TXC9RHG5\Tanner - 2019 - Robust neurocognitive individual differences in gr.pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\MP8PK7H3\S0010945218303447.html,NA,Individual differences; ERP; Grammatical agreement; LAN; N400; P600,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001176,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\TXC9RHG5\Tanner - 2019 - Robust neurocognitive individual differences in gr.pdf,TRUE

This apparent lack of concern has been attributed to people's deeply-entrenched belief in economic mobility – the belief that through hard work, determination, and skill people are able to rise up the economic ladder. Little is known, however, about why Americans so strongly believe in economic mobility. In five studies (N = 3112, including two pre-registered studies, one with a large, income-stratified sample), I examine the relationship between economic inequality and the belief in economic mobility. I find that people (accurately) perceive a negative relationship between economic inequality and economic mobility, and that this is due to the attributions they make about wealth and poverty. As economic inequality rises, people increasingly attribute economic success and failure to external factors that are beyond a person's control (vs. internal dispositions), and therefore expect economic mobility to drop. As a consequence, people's tendency to underestimate economic inequality reinforces their belief in economic mobility. I discuss how these findings contribute to our understanding of lay beliefs about the economic system and public opinion regarding inequality.",2018-11-01,2019-03-30T16:57:28Z,2019-03-30T16:57:49Z,2019-03-30T16:57:28Z,138-148,NA,79,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,Why do Americans believe in economic mobility?,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\GA8GLQG3\Davidai - 2018 - Why do Americans believe in economic mobility Eco.pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\THTRP49W\S002210311830146X.html,NA,Economic inequality; Economic mobility; Judgment and decision making; Poverty; Wealth,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,2018,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001179,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\GA8GLQG3\Davidai - 2018 - Why do Americans believe in economic mobility Eco.pdf,TRUE

These issues have been the focus of recent debate within the research literature on the Dark Triad, which is a collection of interrelated but theoretically distinct personality constructs made up of narcissism, Machiavellianism and psychopathy. The present paper highlights previous work on the issue of partialling and also makes use of recent developments surrounding meta?analytic structural equation modelling to reliably assess the impact of partialling on the empirical profiles of the Dark Triad components. The results show that numerous interpretive difficulties arise after partialling the overlap among the Dark Triad components, most notably for narcissism and Machiavellianism. The results are discussed in the context of contemporary Dark Triad research in addition to discussing the implications for structural equation modelling methods in personality psychology more generally. Recommendations are made for how future research can mitigate the interpretive difficulties that may arise from partialling.

Importantly, the activation of embodied object representations depends on contextual information. In the present study, we use a visual masking paradigm to investigate how the availability of visual information modulates the role of manipulability in the representation of object concepts. Using both an object naming task (i.e., linguistic response) and a picture-word matching task (i.e., manual response), we provide evidence that structural manipulability (the ability to pick up an object with one hand) and functional manipulability (the action information that pertains to the ultimate use of the object) have dissociable effects on object identification. In both tasks, the effects of structural manipulability were greater when structural information was available in the image (i.e., when the objects were unmasked); in contrast, the effects of functional manipulability were greater when the objects were masked. Importantly, these effects were not due to object familiarity or the age at which the name of the objects was acquired. Our results are consistent with the activation of the two pathways within the dorsal visual stream that are part of a distributed neural network that represents embodied action information.

It was therefore predicted that sexist and rape jokes would increase rape myth acceptance and sexist behavior. Participants were 96 undergraduates.

Given that speech segmentation represents a potential bottleneck for language acquisition, patterns in speech may be extracted very rapidly, without extensive exposure. This hypothesis was examined by exposing participants to continuous speech streams composed of novel repeating nonsense words. Learning was measured on-line using a reaction time task. After merely one exposure to an embedded novel word, learners demonstrated significant learning effects, as revealed by faster responses to predictable than to unpredictable syllables. These results demonstrate that learners gained sensitivity to the statistical structure of unfamiliar speech on a very rapid timescale.

Driven by the requirements of energy impact modellers, policymakers and building design experts; a new historical high-spatial resolution, global gridded dataset of degree-days constructed using various base (threshold) temperatures (Tb) is presented in this study. Derived using sub-daily temperature from a quality-controlled reanalysis data product (Global Land Data Assimilation System—GLDAS), the dataset called ‘DegDays_0p25_1970_2018’ includes monthly and annual (i) CDD; (ii) HDD; and (iii) CDD computed using wet-bulb temperature (CDDwb) at 0.25° × 0.25° gridded resolution, covering 49 years over the period 1970–2018. The Tb used for assembling DegDays_0p25_1970_2018 include 18, 18.3, 22, 23, 24, 25°C for CDD and CDDwb; and 10, 15, 15.5, 16, 17 and 18°C for HDD, respectively. The data of individual indices are made publicly available in the commonly used scientific Network Common Data Form 4 (NetCDF4) and Georeferenced Tagged Image File (GeoTIFF) formats. DegDays_0p25_1970_2018 fills gaps in existing energy indicators’ datasets by being the only high-resolution historical global gridded time series based on multiple threshold temperatures, thus offering applications in wide-ranging climate zones and thermal comfort environments. The richness of DegDays_0p25_1970_2018 lies in its flexibility by allowing users to aggregate the degree-days not only at varying spatial scales (such as administrative levels, national boundaries, economic organizations e.g. OECD; with or without population weights), but also at varying temporal scales (such as seasons), thereby offering climatologists with a potential to examine global teleconnection patterns more discretely.",2019,2020-02-03T04:50:11Z,2020-02-03T04:50:43Z,2020-02-03T04:50:11Z,214-221,2,6,NA,Historical global gridded degree-days,NA,en,© 2019 The Authors.

Here, we investigated whether resource-dependent control processes modulate the effect of reward on attentional capture, much as for the effect of physical salience. To this end, we used eye tracking with a rewarded visual search task and compared performance under conditions of high and low working memory load. In two experiments, we demonstrated that oculomotor capture by high-reward distractor stimuli is enhanced under high memory load.

Cue validity (how often a cue was present and correct) and dominance were also manipulated. In Experiment 1, where the morphological cues were low in validity but highly dominant, VIE helped participants to acquire and strengthen one morphological cue (case marking) but not the other (verb agreement).

However, credulity entails risks. The optimal level of credulity depends on the relative costs of believing misinformation and failing to attend to accurate information. When information concerns hazards, erroneous incredulity is often more costly than erroneous credulity, given that disregarding accurate warnings is more harmful than adopting unnecessary precautions. Because no equivalent asymmetry exists for information concerning benefits, people should generally be more credulous of hazard information than of benefit information. This adaptive negatively biased credulity is linked to negativity bias in general and is more prominent among people who believe the world to be more dangerous. Because both threat sensitivity and beliefs about the dangerousness of the world differ between conservatives and liberals, we predicted that conservatism would positively correlate with negatively biased credulity.

But what happens when powerful people also are ambivalent? On the basis of the self-validation theory of judgment, we hypothesized that power and ambivalence would interact to predict individuals’ action. Because power can validate individuals’ reactions, we reasoned that feeling powerful strengthens whatever reactions people have during a decision. It can strengthen univalent reactions and increase action orientation, as shown in past research. Among people who hold an ambivalent judgment, however, those who feel powerful would be less action oriented than those who feel powerless.

Accordingly, one might expect that ideological uncertainty would lead individuals to engage more deeply with the political domain in order to acquire a sufficient level of subjective certainty that the ideological orientation they have adopted is the “right” one. Given the inherent complexity and ambiguity of the political realm, however, we propose that ideological uncertainty should instead undermine political efficacy and interest, thereby motivating individuals to disengage and withdrawal from participating in electoral politics. Using both correlational and experimental methods, we conduct four studies on both convenience and representative samples in the context of two electoral contexts to test this hypothesis. Study 1 (N = 343) and Study 2 (N = 1054) demonstrate that ideological uncertainty covaries with reduced levels of political engagement and participation in the 2012 and 2016 U.S. Presidential Election, respectively. Study 3 (N = 170) and Study 4 (N = 798) replicate and extend the results of Study 1 and 2 by experimentally manipulating ideological uncertainty using an original and innovative false-feedback paradigm. We demonstrate the causal effect of ideological uncertainty on political engagement (independent of demographic variables, political knowledge, and ideological extremity and conviction), and find that it is particularly pronounced among individuals who reflect on the meaning of their political judgment and behaviors for their political orientation.

Whereas theoretical accounts and empirical examinations of the sunk-cost effect have generally been based on the assumption that it is a purely intrapersonal phenomenon (i.e., solely driven by one’s own past investments), the present research demonstrates that it is also an interpersonal effect (i.e., people will alter their choices in response to other people’s past investments). Across eight experiments (N = 6,076) covering diverse scenarios, I documented sunk-cost effects when the costs are borne by someone other than the decision maker.

Motivation can modulate these changes. Specifically, when a cue indicates that a reward can be obtained, CS excitability initially increases, followed by a pronounced decrease. This dynamic could reflect processes related to reward expectancy, processes related to action preparation, or a combination of both. Here we set up two experiments to dissociate these accounts. A rewarded choice reaction time task was used in which individuals were cued at the beginning of each trial whether or not a response would be required at target onset and whether or not a reward could be obtained. We used single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (spTMS) over the left primary motor cortex (M1) early (shortly after cue onset) or late (shortly before target onset) preceding target onset to examine CS excitability during motivated action preparation. Electromyography (EMG) was obtained from the right first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle. In the first experiment, we used a lenient response deadline, whereas a strict response time-out procedure was employed in the second experiment. Reward modulated CS excitability differentially only in the second experiment: CS excitability was highest during reward anticipation for the early stimulation epoch and was reduced for the late stimulation epoch when individuals were required to prepare a response, while CS excitability remained unchanged during non-reward anticipation. Our findings suggest that the reward effect on CS excitability is dependent on the actual implementation of effort to attain reward (i.e., the preparation of an actual action), as well as on temporal requirements (i.e., time pressure) invoked by the task.",2019-11-01,2020-01-30T07:56:08Z,2020-01-30T11:28:17Z,2020-01-30T07:56:08Z,159-168,NA,120,Cortex,NA,NA,en,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\2CABTSBK\Bundt et al. - 2019 - Reward anticipation changes corticospinal excitabi.pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\9WKTNX76\S0010945219302321.html,NA,Primary motor cortex; Transcranial magnetic stimulation; Corticospinal excitability; Response preparation; Reward,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001227,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\2CABTSBK\Bundt et al. - 2019 - Reward anticipation changes corticospinal excitabi.pdf,TRUE

This process depends on the plasticity of our sensory systems. The so-called ventriloquism aftereffect—a shift in the perceived localization of sounds presented alone after repeated exposure to spatially mismatched auditory and visual stimuli—is a clear example of this type of plasticity in the audiovisual domain. In a series of six studies with 24 participants each, we investigated an imagery-induced ventriloquism aftereffect in which imagining a visual stimulus elicits the same frequency-specific auditory aftereffect as actually seeing one.

Some have argued that early life SES can fundamentally shift time preferences per se, such that those from low SES backgrounds favor current rewards over future rewards. Others have argued that, while early life SES has lasting effects on behavior, such effects are only observable in the presence of salient cues to mortality. Here, we propose an alternative framework that centers on environmental uncertainty. In this uncertainty management framework, early life deprivation promotes the development of strategies that minimize the downside costs of uncertainty across domains. We argue that this focus on managing uncertainty results in greater risk-aversion, present-orientation, and prosociality. Furthermore, these effects need not be dependent on salient cues to mortality. Across four large samples of participants (total N = 4714), we find that childhood deprivation uniquely predicts greater risk-aversion (both incentivized and hypothetical) and greater prosociality in economic games.

While recent research argues that remittances have a pernicious effect on politics by contributing to authoritarian stability, we argue the opposite: Remittances increase political protest in nondemocracies by augmenting the resources available to potential political opponents. Using cross-national data on a latent measure of antigovernment political protest, we show that remittances increase protest.

To examine this possibility, in the first study, we presented Latina women with a fictional STEM company and a scientist working at the company who was either Latino/a or a non-Latino/a White man or woman. We found that compared to those in the White man or woman scientist conditions, participants in the Latino/a scientist conditions believed the scientist had faced comparable adversity to themselves, identified more strongly with the scientist, and reported higher trust and belonging and attraction to the STEM company. Using the findings from Study 1 to inform a new intervention, in the second study we presented Latina high school students with a panel of Latina scientists. Relative to before the panel, the students reported enhanced feelings of trust and belonging in STEM after the panel. Exploratory analyses further revealed that among Latina students who did not already intend to pursue a career in STEM, the panel encouraged their interest in the sciences.

When assessed during the resting state, it is regarded as an index of trait approach and withdrawal motivation. However, the replicability of these associations with personality is currently unclear. The present meta-analysis seeks to provide a comprehensive quantitative review of the relationship between personality traits and resting electroencephalographic (EEG) frontal asymmetry. We distinguished five personality clusters: extraversion, neuroticism, impulsivity, anger, and defensiveness. Data from 79 independent samples with overall 5700 participants were included in the meta-analysis. The results revealed that less than 0.4% of the variance in extraversion and neuroticism could be explained by resting frontal asymmetry. Similarly, a small effect was observed for trait anger, and a small-sized to medium-sized effect was observed for defensiveness, although the number of studies was very low. No significant effect emerged for impulsivity. The effects were further reduced after adjustment for publication bias. Given some evidence for heterogeneity, sub-traits were analysed, and methodological moderators were investigated. Based on the results, we conclude that the validity of resting frontal asymmetry as a marker for personality is not supported.

While contemporary models consider hoarding and obsessive-compulsive disorder distinct, the related behaviours have not been separately examined in patients with FTD, and the neuroanatomical correlates of hoarding in patients with FTD have not been previously examined (American Psychiatric Association, 2013; Grisham and Baldwin, 2015; Mataix-Cols et al., 2010). Methods Patients with FTD who were evaluated between 2004 and 2018 at our centre were included. Cortical thickness and subcortical volumetric analyses were completed on available T1 high resolution anatomic scans using FreeSurfer. Results Eighty-seven patients met inclusion criteria, and 49 had scans available for quantitative MRI volumetric analysis. New hoarding behaviours were present in 29% of patients and were more common in the semantic variant subtype of FTD, while 49% of individuals had new or increased OCB. Hoarding behaviours were associated with decreased thickness in a factor comprised of left temporal, insular and anterior cingulate cortices. The presence of OCB was predicted by reduced cortical thickness and volumes in a factor comprised of the anterior cingulate and subcortical volumes in the bilateral amygdala and hippocampus. OCB were associated with greater right temporal cortical thickness in comparison to patients with hoarding. Discussion The association of the semantic variant with hoarding, together with the observed associations between left temporal atrophy and hoarding indicate that degeneration of the left temporal lobe has a role in the emergence of hoarding in FTD. As in current models of Hoarding disorder and Obsessive–Compulsive disorder, our results suggest that in patients with FTD, hoarding and OCB are clinically and anatomically partially dissociable phenomenon. The results may also help to further elucidate the cognitive processes and neural networks contributing to Hoarding disorder and Obsessive–Compulsive disorder in persons without dementia.",2019-12-01,2020-01-30T08:09:09Z,2020-01-30T12:00:19Z,2020-01-30T08:09:08Z,443-453,NA,121,Cortex,Hoarding and obsessive–compulsive behaviours in frontotemporal dementia,NA,en,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\2TY3YXYL\Mitchell et al. - 2019 - Hoarding and obsessive–compulsive behaviours in fr.pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\FMQ37VJA\S001094521930334X.html,NA,Frontotemporal dementia; Hoarding; Neuropsychiatry; Obsessive-compulsive; Semantic variant,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001239,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\2TY3YXYL\Mitchell et al. - 2019 - Hoarding and obsessive–compulsive behaviours in fr.pdf,TRUE

Such reliance on object-based representations would predict that after an object is fully encoded into VWM, all features of that object would need to be maintained as a coherent unit. Here, we evaluated this idea by testing whether memory resources can be redeployed to a specific feature of an object already stored in VWM. We found that observers can utilize a retrospective cue presented during the maintenance period to attenuate both the gradual deterioration and complete loss of memory for a cued feature over time, but at the cost of accelerated loss of information regarding the uncued feature.

We argue that this pre-aggregation is less innocuous than it seems, costing applied researchers opportunities for improved inference. First, researchers cannot evaluate the consequences of different methods of report aggregation. Second, aggregation discards report-level information (i.e., variation across reports) that is useful in addressing measurement error inherent in event data. Therefore, we advocate that data should be supplied and analyzed at the report level. We demonstrate the consequences of using aggregated event data as a predictor or outcome variable, and how analysis can be improved using report-level information directly.

This study examined the effects of blocking and interleaving on L2 grammar learning. In this study, 115 Japanese learners studied 5 English grammatical structures under 1 of 3 conditions: blocking, interleaving, and increasing (i.e., blocking followed by interleaving). Learning was measured using a grammaticality judgment test administered immediately and 1 week after the treatment. Although interleaving led to the highest number of incorrect responses during training, it was more effective than blocking in the 1-week delayed posttest. These results indicate that the advantage of interleaving extends to L2 grammar learning. Furthermore, learners’ levels of prior knowledge were found to moderate the effects of interleaving.

Consequently, Congress has turned to other means of influence, including the appropriations and oversight processes, although questions remain about the degree to which they have been effective. To investigate, I study a spatial model of administrative policymaking that assumes Congress can execute a legislative veto, as well as a baseline model in which congressional influence requires a coalition with the president.

Despite this common basis, recent research has shown that the consistency of people's choices across different mixed-motive games is rather low. The present research examined behavioural consistency within the same mixed-motive game, by presenting participants with a series of one-shot Prisoner's Dilemma Games. Across this set of games, payoffs were manipulated in order to intensify or weaken the conflict between self and the other party while maintaining the game's underlying structure. Our findings indicate that significant differences in choice behaviour are observed as a function of both situational (i.e. manipulations of the Prisoner's Dilemma Game's payoff structure) and personality differences (i.e. individual differences in personality and motivational traits). Moreover, our included situational variables and personality features did not interact with each other and were about equally impactful in shaping cooperation. Crucially, however, despite the significant behavioural differences across game variants, considerable consistency in choices was found as well, which suggests that the game's motivational basis reliably impacts choice behaviour in spite of situational and personality variations. We discuss implications for theorizing on mixed-motive situations and elaborate on the question how cooperation can be promoted. © 2018 European Association of Personality Psychology",2018,2019-03-20T17:32:27Z,2019-03-20T17:33:31Z,2019-03-20T17:32:27Z,405-426,4,32,NA,Behavioural Consistency Within the Prisoner's Dilemma Game,NA,en,© 2018 European Association of Personality Psychology,Wiley Online Library,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\6NCNRDFX\Haesevoets e.a. - 2018 - Behavioural Consistency Within the Prisoner's Dile.pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\HP947MSE\per.html,NA,personality; game variations; person–situation debate; Prisoner's Dilemma Game; within-game consistency,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2018,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001249,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\6NCNRDFX\Haesevoets e.a. - 2018 - Behavioural Consistency Within the Prisoner's Dile.pdf,TRUE

Using self-reports from over 3000 representative German twin pairs of three birth cohorts, we could replicate previous findings on the primary role of genetic sources accounting for the unfolding of inter-individual differences in personality traits and stabilizing trait differences during adolescence. More specifically, the genetic variance increased between early (ages 10–12 years) and late (ages 16–18 years) adolescence and stabilized between late adolescence and young adulthood (ages 21–25 years). This trend could be confirmed in a second three-wave longitudinal study of adolescents' personality self-reports and parent ratings from about 1400 Norwegian twin families (average ages between 15 and 20 years). Moreover, the longitudinal study provided evidence for increasing genetic differences being primarily due to accumulation of novel genetic influences instead of an amplification of initial genetic variation. This is in line with cumulative interaction effects between twins' correlated genetic makeups and environmental circumstances shared by adolescent twins reared together. In other words, nature × nurture interactions rather than transactions can account for increases in genetic variance and thus personality variance during adolescence. © 2019 European Association of Personality Psychology",2019,2020-01-30T12:38:35Z,2020-01-30T12:41:59Z,2020-01-30T12:38:35Z,221-244,3,33,NA,NA,NA,en,© 2019 European Association of Personality Psychology,Wiley Online Library,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\VBLGPRWK\Kandler et al. - 2019 - Unravelling the Interplay Between Genetic and Envi.pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\HNA7GM5L\per.html,NA,twin study; adolescence; genetic and environmental variance; genotype × environment transaction and interaction; personality differences,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001250,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\VBLGPRWK\Kandler et al. - 2019 - Unravelling the Interplay Between Genetic and Envi.pdf,TRUE

First, they can display different trajectories (e.g., increases or decreases) on constructs of interest. Second, the configuration of group members’ responses within a group can change, such that the members become more or less similar to each other. Psychologists have historically been interested in understanding changes in groups over time; however, there is currently no comprehensive quantitative framework for studying and modeling group processes over time. We present a multilevel framework for such research—the multilevel group-process framework (MGPF). The MGPF builds on a statistical approach developed to capture whether individual members of a group develop a shared climate over time, but we extend the core ideas in two important ways. First, we describe how researchers can gain insights into group phenomena such as group leniency, group learning, groupthink, group extremity, group forming, group freezing, and group adjourning through modeling change in latent mean levels and consensus. Second, we present a sequence of model-testing steps that enable researchers to systematically study and contrast different group processes.

This study examined to which extent the neural processes involved in recognising personally familiar faces depend on attentional resources by analysing event-related brain potentials. In two experiments, participants were presented with multiple ambient images of highly personally familiar and unfamiliar faces and pictures of butterflies, with a letter string superimposed on each image. Their task was either to indicate when a butterfly occurred (effectively ignoring the letter strings) or to indicate whether each letter string contained the letter X or N. Attentional resource load was manipulated in the letter task by presenting the target among different distractor letters (high load; Experiment 1) or by using only a single repeated letter in each string (low load; Experiment 2). ERPs revealed more negative amplitudes for familiar relative to unfamiliar faces under both high and low load conditions, both in the N250, reflecting the activation of perceptual face representations, and in the subsequent Sustained Familiarity Effect (SFE). Nonetheless, while the magnitude of the N250 effect was not substantially affected by attentional load, the SFE was still present but reduced in the high relative to the low load experiment. These findings suggest that perceptual face representations are activated independent of the demands of a competing task. However, the subsequent SFE, presumably reflecting more sustained activation needed to access identity-specific knowledge that can guide potential interactions, strongly relies on the availability of attentional resources.",2019-11-01,2020-01-30T07:56:19Z,2020-01-30T11:28:26Z,2020-01-30T07:56:19Z,147-158,NA,120,Cortex,Later but not early stages of familiar face recognition depend strongly on attentional resources,NA,en,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\ERH5BIXS\Wiese et al. - 2019 - Later but not early stages of familiar face recogn.pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\6YXY9NTD\S0010945219302357.html,NA,Face recognition; Event-related potentials; N250; Resource load; Sustained familiarity effect,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001263,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\ERH5BIXS\Wiese et al. - 2019 - Later but not early stages of familiar face recogn.pdf,TRUE

Contrary to the “race to the bottom” hypothesis, it finds that retail importers reward exporters for complying with social standards. In difference-in-differences estimates from over 2,000 manufacturing establishments in 36 countries, achieving compliance is associated with a 4% [1%, 7%] average increase in annual purchasing.

The onset of the selection negativity, an ERP component indexing attentional modulation, was about 60 msec earlier for trained than untrained stimuli.

The scalp distribution and timecourse of these components were better matched by studies of orthography than object expertise. Source localization using eLORETA suggested that the strongest neural sources of the selection negativity were in right ventral temporal cortex whereas the strongest sources of the N200/N320 components were in left ventral temporal cortex, again consistent with the hypothesis that training recruited orthography related areas.

Upon crossing some threshold, neural signals are globally broadcast throughout the brain and allow conscious reports. However, whether subjective experience (phenomenal consciousness) is categorical (i.e., transitioning abruptly from unconscious to conscious states) or graded (i.e., characterized by multiple intermediate states) remains an open question. To address this issue, we built a series of artificial neural networks containing distinct feedback connectivity from “multisensory” to “unisensory” cortices. In line with consciousness theories, we operationalized perceptual consciousness by the presence of feedback from higher-order nodes back to unisensory nodes which allow ‘neural ignition’ – a rapid, non-linear boost in response putatively leading to phenomenal consciousness. When simulating how these networks responded to unisensory and multisensory inputs, we found the fastest responses for multisensory presentations associated with multisensory feedback, and the slowest responses for multisensory presentations without feedback. Most interestingly, despite being built in line with “all-or-none” models of consciousness, multisensory stimuli associated with unisensory feedback (i.e., auditory or visual), and hence consistent with unisensory phenomenology according to theories of consciousness, generated intermediate reaction times. To extend these models to human perception and performance, we conducted extensive psychophysical testing in 29 subjects who each completed 10 h of a multisensory cue-congruency task. Consistent with the modeling results, we found that reaction times to multisensory cues reported as unisensory were intermediate between those of fully aware and fully unaware cues. These results support the existence of graded forms of phenomenological consciousness that can be instantiated by simple neural networks built in line with “all-or-none” models of consciousness.",2019-11-01,2020-01-30T07:55:57Z,2020-01-30T11:14:01Z,2020-01-30T07:55:56Z,169-180,NA,120,Cortex,Multisensory perceptual awareness,NA,en,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\XD8T7VVG\Noel et al. - 2019 - Multisensory perceptual awareness Categorical or .pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\D77RU2U7\S0010945219302291.html,NA,Consciousness; Multisensory; Global neuronal workspace; Neural networks; Psychophysics,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001277,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\XD8T7VVG\Noel et al. - 2019 - Multisensory perceptual awareness Categorical or .pdf,TRUE

The most common method of analysis has been the cross-lagged panel model (CLPM). The CLPM does not separate between-person effects from within-person effects, making it unclear whether the results from previous studies actually reflect the within-person effects or whether they reflect differences between people. We investigated the associations between self-esteem and depressive symptoms at the within-person level, using random intercept cross-lagged panel models (RI-CLPMs). To get an impression of the magnitude of possible differences between the RI-CLPM and the CLPM, we compared the results of both models. We used data from three longitudinal adolescent samples (age range: 7?18 years; study 1: N = 1948; study 2: N = 1455; study 3: N = 316). Intervals between the measurements were 1?1.5 years. Single-paper meta-analyses showed support for small within-person associations from self-esteem to depressive symptoms, but not the other way around, thus only providing some support for the vulnerability model. The cross-lagged associations in the aggregated RI-CLPM and CLPM showed similar effect sizes. Overall, our results show that over 1- to 1.5-year time intervals, low self-esteem may negatively influence depressive symptoms over time within adolescents, but only weakly so. ? 2018 The Authors.

I show that the justice cascade has a differential effect on leaders based on their culpability (whether they presided over atrocity crimes). In the past, culpable and nonculpable leaders went into exile at virtually identical rates. Today, however, culpable leaders are about six times less likely to flee abroad because exile no longer guarantees a safe retirement. These findings raise stark implications for existing research that debates whether international justice deters atrocities or prolongs conflicts.

Its converse is pity, a negative state elicited by downward comparisons towards worse-off others. Both classes of emotions first require us to infer what a person's life as a whole must be like. However, the “focusing illusion” suggests these impressions of others are incomplete: we may overweight extreme features (the exceptionally good circumstances of envied others and exceptionally bad circumstances of pitied others) at the cost of overlooking the smaller ups and downs of daily life, which inevitably dilute the other person's overall experience. If so, envy and pity could involve misperceiving that envied others have lives that are uniformly wonderful (overlooking that they still face smaller annoyances) and pitied others have lives that are uniformly awful (overlooking that they still enjoy smaller pleasures). Five studies support this possibility. First, participants evaluated different peers. Consistent with focalism, the more envy and pity they felt, the more disparities they perceived (Study 1)—yet the actual everyday lives of envied and pitied others were similar (Study 2). Participants then completed various defocusing tasks designed to bring to mind others' smaller ups and downs. This indeed reduced envy and pity (Studies 3–4a–4b–5), but pity proved harder to reduce (Studies 4b–5).

While previous studies posit that such biases are driven by politicians' motivations to target benefits directly to certain groups of ordinary voters, this article develops the argument that national politicians also target pork along partisan lines to win over politicians at lower levels of government whose cooperation they need to ensure the successful implementation of development projects. Using a quasi-experimental design, the argument is tested with data on thousands of public works projects sanctioned by MPs in North India. The results show that, even controlling for unobserved differences in voter characteristics, MPs systematically favored the constituencies of co-partisan state legislators when allocating pork specifically under conditions implied by the argument and not otherwise.

We argue that states often seek to reveal intelligence about other states' violations of international rules and laws but are deterred by concerns about revealing the sources and methods used to collect it. Properly equipped international organizations, however, can mitigate these dilemmas by analyzing and acting on sensitive information while protecting it from wide dissemination. Using new data on intelligence disclosures to the International Atomic Energy Agency and an analysis of the full universe of nuclear proliferation cases, we demonstrate that strengthening the agency's intelligence protection capabilities led to greater intelligence sharing and fewer suspected nuclear facilities.

Relatedly, people rely more on affective processing when social distance is small in the life-saving domain, but not in the valuables-saving domain (Study 3). Furthermore, in the life-saving domain social distance exerts an effect on risk preference under affective processing but not under deliberate processing, whereas, in the valuables-saving domain, social distance influences risk preference under deliberate processing but not under affective processing (Study 4).

Narcissism is characterized by little empathy for the victim, which reduces guilt about one's transgressions. Low guilt, in turn, is associated with unwillingness to apologize. In Study 1, we assessed dispositional narcissism, empathy, guilt, and willingness to apologize. In Study 2, we assessed dispositional narcissism and obtained state measures of empathy, guilt, and willingness to apologize. In Study 3, we manipulated narcissism and collected state measures of empathy, guilt, and willingness to apologize. Narcissism was negatively associated with (Studies 1?2) and decreased (Study 3) willingness to apologize, with this link being explained (i.e., serially mediated) by low empathy and guilt. Finally, in Study 4, we showed that antagonistic narcissism (i.e., narcissistic rivalry), but not agentic narcissism (i.e., narcissistic admiration), was negatively associated with willingness to apologize and apologizing behaviour. In all, narcissists are unwilling to apologize for their transgressions, as they experience little empathy for their victims and lower guilt.

Outstanding questions concern what causes excuse validation, and whether it is peculiar to American moral psychology or cross-culturally robust. The present paper studies the phenomenon cross-culturally, focusing on Korean and American adults, and proposes a new explanation of why people engage in excuse validation, in terms of competing forces in human norm-psychology. The principal findings are that Americans and Koreans engaged in excuse validation at similar levels, and older adults were more likely to engage in excuse validation.

An important and practically relevant question is whether some children are more vulnerable for the effects of psychologically controlling parenting. In the current diary study, we investigated whether daily psychologically controlling parenting relates to children's daily externalizing and internalizing problems and whether these associations depend on child personality. A total of 206 children (M age = 9.93 years; 46.6% female) along with their mothers and fathers (M age = 40.30 and 42.40 years) participated in this multi-informant diary study. All three family members filled out a diary each day for seven days. Multilevel analyses indicated that daily maternal and paternal psychological control were positively related to daily externalizing and internalizing problems, a pattern that was fairly consistent across informants. Out of the 35 interactions tested, only three turned out to be significant. Overall, the limited number of interactions suggests that psychologically controlling parenting is generally detrimental to children's daily functioning. Still, children differ somewhat in their susceptibility to the effect of psychologically controlling parenting. ? 2018 European Association of Personality Psychology",2018-07-01,2019-03-20T17:34:58Z,2019-03-20T17:37:39Z,2019-03-20T17:34:58Z,459-479,4,32,European Journal of Personality,The Role of Child Personality in Effects of Psychologically Controlling Parenting,NA,NA,NA,onlinelibrary.wiley.com (Atypon),NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\HAKDCR4G\Mabbe e.a. - 2018 - The Role of Child Personality in Effects of Psycho.pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\M9FTHQU6\per.html,NA,personality; diary; parenting; psychological control,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,2018,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001295,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\HAKDCR4G\Mabbe e.a. - 2018 - The Role of Child Personality in Effects of Psycho.pdf,TRUE

For second language (L2) grammar learning, some studies reveal advantages for spacing of 7 days or more, but others for shorter spacing. Further, little is known about the role of cognitive individual differences (e.g., language analytic ability; LAA) in mediating practice distribution effects for L2 grammatical knowledge development and retention. To address this gap, this classroom-based study investigated whether distribution of practice and LAA moderated the effectiveness of explicit, input-based grammar instruction for young first language (L1) English learners of French (aged 8 to 11). The study revealed minimal differences between longer (7-day) versus shorter (3.5-day) spacing of practice for learning a French verb inflection subsystem, at either posttest or delayed posttest. Minimal group-level gains and substantial within-group variation in performance at posttests were observed. Accuracy of practice during training and LAA were significantly associated with posttest performance under both practice schedules. These findings indicated that within an ecologically valid classroom context, differences in distribution of practice had limited impact on learner performance on our tests; rather, individual learner differences were more critical in moderating learning.

This link from inauthenticity to feeling immoral produced an increased desire among participants to cleanse themselves and to engage in moral compensation by behaving prosocially. We established the role that impurity played in these effects through mediation and moderation. We found that inauthenticity-induced cleansing and compensatory helping were driven by heightened feelings of impurity rather than by the psychological discomfort of dissonance. Similarly, physically cleansing oneself eliminated the relationship between inauthenticity and prosocial compensation. Finally, we obtained additional evidence for discriminant validity: The observed effects on desire for cleansing were not driven by general negative experiences (i.e., failing a test) but were unique to experiences of inauthenticity.

This article focuses on criminal violence and proposes a twofold mechanism to explain why peacekeeping missions, even when effectively reducing conflict, can inadvertently increase criminal violence. First, less conflict opens up economic opportunities (so-called peacekeeping economies) and provides operational security for organized crime, thus increasing violent competition among criminal groups. Second, demobilized combatants are vulnerable to turn to crime because of limited legal livelihood opportunities and their training in warfare. While UN troops may exacerbate these dynamics, UN police's peculiar role is likely to successfully contain criminal violence.

First, this produces an orientation effect: The same container is judged larger when right side up than when upside down because of the greater ease of imagining filling an upright container. Second, we identified a cavern effect: Imagining pouring water through a narrow opening toward a relatively wide base produces a sense that the container is cavernous and large (compared with identically sized, wide-topped, narrow-based containers). By testing for and demonstrating the importance of simulation to these effects, we showed how complex perceptual judgments can be distorted by higher level cognitive influences even when they are necessarily informed by modularly processed perceptual input.",2019-01,2019-04-06T18:43:16Z,2019-04-06T18:43:35Z,2019-04-06T18:43:16Z,80-91,1,30,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,Crossref,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\GVC4VLKK\Perfecto e.a. - 2019 - Volume Estimation Through Mental Simulation.pdf,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001303,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\GVC4VLKK\Perfecto e.a. - 2019 - Volume Estimation Through Mental Simulation.pdf,TRUE

Many scholars believe the answer to this question is that heuristics, biases, and ignorance cause voters to misperceive risk magnitudes. By contrast, this article argues that Americans’ risk priorities primarily reflect judgments about the extent to which some victims deserve more protection than others and the degree to which it is appropriate for government to intervene in different areas of social life. The article supports this argument with evidence drawn from a survey with 3,000 respondents, using pairwise comparisons to elicit novel measures of how respondents perceive nine dimensions of 100 life-threatening risks. Respondents were well informed about these risks’ relative magnitudes—the correlation between perceived and actual mortality was .82—but those perceptions explained relatively little variation in policy preferences relative to judgments about the status of victims and the appropriate role of government. These findings hold regardless of political party, education, and other demographics.

Results indicated that (a) participants performed better on the sentence-verification than on the multiple-choice task independently of age, (b) each testing method revealed a different hierarchy of constructions, and (c) the impact of testing method on participants’ performance was greater for some constructions than others. Our results suggest that young children can understand complex sentences when they are presented in a manner that better reflects how people process language in natural discourse.

Across five experiments (N = 330), we showed that children between 4 and 8 years of age engaged in negative direct reciprocity but generalized positive reciprocity, despite recalling benefactors.

Methods The study protocol has been published at doi: 10.1007/s11192-016-1964-8. Design Observational cohort study. Population Articles describing research in the life sciences published in Nature journals, submitted after 1 May 2013. Intervention Mandatory completion of a checklist during manuscript revision. Comparators (1) Articles describing research in the life sciences published in Nature journals, submitted before May 2013; and (2) similar articles in other journals matched for date and topic. Primary outcome The primary outcome is change in the proportion of Nature articles describing in vivo research published before and after May 2013 reporting the ‘Landis 4’ items (randomisation, blinding, sample size calculation and exclusions). We included 448 Nature Publishing Group (NPG) articles (223 published before May 2013, and 225 after) identified by an individual hired by NPG for this specific task, working to a standard procedure; and an independent investigator used PubMed ‘Related Citations’ to identify 448 non-NPG articles with a similar topic and date of publication from other journals; and then redacted all articles for time-sensitive information and journal name. Redacted articles were assessed by two trained reviewers against a 74-item checklist, with discrepancies resolved by a third. Results 394 NPG and 353 matching non-NPG articles described in vivo research. The number of NPG articles meeting all relevant Landis 4 criteria increased from 0/203 prior to May 2013 to 31/181 (16.4%) after (two-sample test for equality of proportions without continuity correction, Χ²=36.2, df=1, p=1.8×10−9). There was no change in the proportion of non-NPG articles meeting all relevant Landis 4 criteria (1/164 before, 1/189 after). There were more substantial improvements in the individual prevalences of reporting of randomisation, blinding, exclusions and sample size calculations for in vivo experiments, and less substantial improvements for in vitro experiments.

One explanation is that people humanize their ingroup to bolster their social identity in the face of their mortality. Alternatively, people might be motivated to see their ingroup as more uniquely human (UH) to distance themselves from their corporeal “animal” nature. These explanations were tested in Australia, where social identity is tied less to UH and more to human nature (HN) which does not distinguish humans from animals. Australians attributed more HN traits to the ingroup when mortality was salient, while the attribution of UH traits remained unchanged. This indicates that the mortality-buffering function of ingroup humanization lies in reinforcing the humanness of our social identity, rather than just distancing ourselves from our animal nature.

In these situations, it is essential to form expectations about the others' behaviour to adapt one's own behaviour to increase mutual outcomes and avoid exploitation. Social value orientation, which describes the dispositional weights individuals attach to their own and to another person's outcome, predicts these expectations of cooperation in social dilemmas?an interdependent situation involving a conflict of interests. Yet, scientific evidence is inconclusive about the exact differences in expectations between prosocials, individualists, and competitors. The present meta?analytic results show that, relative to proselfs (individualists and competitors), prosocials expect more cooperation from others in social dilemmas, whereas individualists and competitors do not significantly differ in their expectations. The importance of these expectations in the decision process is further highlighted by the finding that they partially mediate the well?established relation between social value orientation and cooperative behaviour in social dilemmas. In fact, even proselfs are more likely to cooperate when they expect their partner to cooperate.

However, these problems are also prone to errors due to systematic interference (i.e., co-activation of interconnected but incorrect solutions). Semantic control processes are crucial to overcome this type of interference and to retrieve the correct information. Previous research suggests the importance of several brain regions such as the left inferior frontal cortex and the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) for semantic control. But, this evidence is mainly based on tasks measuring interference during the processing of lexico-semantic information (e.g., pictures or words). Here, we investigated whether semantic control during arithmetic problem solving (i.e., multiplication fact retrieval) draws upon similar or different brain mechanisms as in other semantic domains (i.e., lexico-semantic). The brain activity of 46 students was measured with fMRI while participants performed an operand-related-lure (OR) and a picture-word (PW) task. In the OR task participants had to verify the correctness of a given solution to a single-digit multiplication. Similarly, in the PW task, participants had to judge whether a presented word matches the concept displayed in a picture or not. Analyses showed that resolving interference in these two tasks modulates the activation of a widespread fronto-parietal network (e.g., left/right IFG, left insula lobe, left IPS). Importantly, conjunction analysis revealed a neural overlap in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) pars triangularis and left IPS. Additional Bayesian analyses showed that regions that are thought to store lexico-semantic information (e.g., left middle temporal gyrus) did not show evidence for an arithmetic interference effect. Overall, our findings not only indicate that semantic control plays an important role in arithmetic problem solving but also that it is supported by common brain regions across semantic domains. Additionally, by conducting Bayesian analysis we confirmed the hypothesis that the semantic control network contributes differently to semantic tasks of various domains.",2019-11-01,2020-01-30T07:54:40Z,2020-01-30T11:12:25Z,2020-01-30T07:54:40Z,375-393,NA,120,Cortex,Interference during the retrieval of arithmetic and lexico-semantic knowledge modulates similar brain regions,NA,en,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\A6YLB54I\Heidekum et al. - 2019 - Interference during the retrieval of arithmetic an.pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\V3ITY8MA\S0010945219302382.html,NA,Intraparietal sulcus; Inferior frontal gyrus; Arithmetic fact; Interference; Semantic control,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001336,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\A6YLB54I\Heidekum et al. - 2019 - Interference during the retrieval of arithmetic an.pdf,TRUE

This is usually explained by the idea that an initial moral act affirms the moral self-image and hence licenses subsequent immoral acts. Previous meta-analyses on moral licensing indicate significant overall effects of d> .30. However, several large replication studies have either not found the effect or reported a substantially smaller effect size. The present article investigated whether this can be attributed to publication bias. Datasets from two previous meta-analyses on moral licensing were compared and when necessary modified. The larger dataset was used for the present analyses. Using PET-PEESE and a three-parameter-selection-model (3-PSM), we found some evidence for publication bias. The adjusted effect sizes were reduced to d= -0.05, p= .64 and d= 0.18, p= .002, respectively. While the first estimate could be an underestimation, we also found indications that the second estimate might exaggerate the true effect size. It is concluded that both the evidence for and the size of moral licensing effects has likely been inflated by publication bias. Furthermore, our findings indicate that culture moderates the moral licensing effect. Recommendations for future meta-analytic and empirical work are given.

We report four well-powered, incentive-compatible experiments in which we evaluated two possible ways that restaurants might comply with such a policy: bundling (i.e., dividing the contents of oversized cups into two regulation-size cups) and providing free refills (i.e., offering a regulation-size cup with unlimited refills). Bundling caused people to buy less soda. Free refills increased consumption, especially when a waiter served the refills. This perverse effect was reduced in self-service contexts that required walking just a few steps to get a refill.",2017-05-01,2018-03-20T00:35:02Z,2018-03-20T00:35:16Z,2018-03-20T00:35:02Z,620-629,5,28,Psychol Sci,NA,NA,en,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\MZZAWUBD\John et al. - 2017 - Psychologically Informed Implementations of Sugary.pdf,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2017,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001338,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\MZZAWUBD\John et al. - 2017 - Psychologically Informed Implementations of Sugary.pdf,TRUE

During this time-limited reconsolidation window, reactivated existing memories can be strengthened, weakened or updated with new information. Previous studies have shown that non-invasive stimulation of the lateral prefrontal cortex after memory reactivation strengthened existing verbal episodic memories through reconsolidation, an effect documented by enhanced delayed memory recall (24 h post-reactivation). However, it remains unknown whether the left posterior parietal cortex (PPC), a region involved during reactivation of existing episodic memories, contributes to reconsolidation. To address this question, in this double-blind experiment healthy participants (n = 27) received transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) with the anode over the left PPC after reactivation of previously learned verbal episodic memories. Memory recall was tested 24 h later. To rule out unspecific effects of memory reactivation or tDCS alone, we included two control groups: one that receives tDCS with the anode over the left PPC without reactivation (n = 27) and another one that receives tDCS with the anode over a control site (primary visual cortex) after reactivation (n = 27). We hypothesized that tDCS with the anode over the left PPC after memory reactivation would enhance delayed recall through reconsolidation relative to the two control groups. No significant between groups differences in the mean number of words recalled on day 3 occurred, suggesting no beneficial effect of tDCS over the left PPC. Alternative explanations were discussed, including efficacy of tDCS, different stimulation parameters, electrode montage, and stimulation site within the PPC.",2019-12-01,2020-01-30T08:08:39Z,2020-01-30T11:59:54Z,2020-01-30T08:08:38Z,78-88,NA,121,Cortex,NA,NA,en,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\CIUKFISM\Crossman et al. - 2019 - Effects of transcranial direct current stimulation.pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\TEWXKADY\S0010945219302977.html,NA,tDCS; Parietal cortex; Episodic memory; Long-term memory; Reconsolidation,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001340,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\CIUKFISM\Crossman et al. - 2019 - Effects of transcranial direct current stimulation.pdf,TRUE

This means that long-term memory shares processing resources with the sensorimotor system. The main objective of this work is to provide new evidence in favour of two claims from the embodied cognition framework: (1) memory is grounded on the sensorimotor system, that is, memory shares processing resources with the sensorimotor system, and (2) memory serves at least in part to support action. For this purpose, the present experiment aimed to show that the action context modulates the motor simulation and, consequently, the memory of manipulable objects. Participants were presented with short phrases comprising the name of a manipulable object, and an action verb (“To take a cup”) or an attentional verb (“To see a cup”). During this phase, they had to put their hands in front of them in the control condition, whereas they had to keep them behind their back in the interfering condition. A cued recall test followed after a short distractive letter-matching task, with the verbs serving as cues. Results showed that memory of the words denoting manipulable objects was impaired by the interfering posture when associated with an action verb, but not when associated with an attentional verb. This suggests that a context which does not favour action interferes with motor simulation and thus decreases the memory of manipulable objects. These results provide strong evidence for a grounded account of memory and language.",2019-05-01,2020-02-05T06:02:23Z,2020-02-05T06:02:59Z,2020-02-05T06:02:23Z,1112-1118,5,72,Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology,NA,NA,en,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\XDS6HDAP\Dutriaux et al. - 2019 - How to change your memory of an object with a post.pdf,NA,NA,language; action; Grounded cognition; long-term memory; mental model,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001341,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\XDS6HDAP\Dutriaux et al. - 2019 - How to change your memory of an object with a post.pdf,TRUE

In three studies (N = 501), 7- to 8-year-olds were more likely than 4- to 6-year-olds to create inequity that disadvantaged themselves—a fair type of inequity.

Here, we reanalyzed six data sets using mixture modeling of report errors, and revealed much simpler dynamics. Exposing a problem inherent in previous analyses, we found evidence of a second attentional episode only when the second target (T2) follows the first (T1) by more than 100 to 250 ms.

We hypothesized that the tendency to reason from “is” to “ought” is due in part to a systematic bias in people’s (nonmoral) explanations, whereby regularities (e.g., giving roses on Valentine’s Day) are explained predominantly via inherent or intrinsic facts (e.g., roses are beautiful). In turn, these inherence-biased explanations lead to value-laden downstream conclusions (e.g., it is good to give roses). Consistent with this proposal, results from five studies (N = 629 children and adults) suggested that, from an early age, the bias toward inherence in explanations fosters inferences that imbue observed reality with value.

Studies 1–3 indicated that three well-established examples of self-serving bias—the tendency to rate oneself as better than an average peer, overclaiming personal responsibility for shared household activities, and hindsight bias—were strengthened when people were induced to perceive their partners as unresponsive, but weakened when they were led to perceive their partners as responsive. Study 4, a daily-diary study, demonstrated similar effects of everyday perceptions of responsiveness on hindsight bias, and also found that people reported having been more open to considering alternative, potentially conflicting points of view when they felt that their social environment was responsive to them.

However, there has been little work to identify different cognitive processes that may be underpinning these delayed memory deficits for mTBI. Frontal cortex is important for delayed memory, and is implicated in the pathophysiology of mTBI; moreover, frontal lobes are typically considered the locus of executive abilities. To further explore these relationships, we sought to partly explain delayed memory deficits after mTBI by examining behavioral indicators of executive function. Results showed that sub-acute as well as chronic mTBI patients performed worse than controls on the delayed memory trial of the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (Brandt & Benedict, 2001), recalling approximately 18% and 15% fewer words, respectively. Furthermore, worse delayed memory performance was associated with less use of the cognitive strategy of semantic clustering, and with lower scores for the executive function composite from a standardized neuropsychological battery (NIH EXAMINER; Kramer et al., 2014). In contrast, serial clustering, a memory organizational strategy thought to be less dependent on executive function, did not show strong relationships to clinical status or delayed memory performance. This exploratory work suggests novel hypotheses to be tested in future, confirmatory studies, including that general executive functions and/or semantic clustering will mediate delayed memory deficits following mTBI.",2019-11-01,2020-01-30T07:53:00Z,2020-01-30T11:10:45Z,2020-01-30T07:53:00Z,240-248,NA,120,Cortex,NA,NA,en,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\LIMP3WGV\Broadway et al. - 2019 - Executive function predictors of delayed memory de.pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\S8CZEJDJ\S0010945219302424.html,NA,Concussion; Delayed free recall; Delayed memory; Executive function; Mild traumatic brain injury; Semantic clustering,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001355,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\LIMP3WGV\Broadway et al. - 2019 - Executive function predictors of delayed memory de.pdf,TRUE

Building on research showing that déjà vu can be driven by an unrecalled memory of a past experience that relates to the current situation, we sought evidence of memory-based predictive ability during déjà vu states. Déjà vu did not lead to above-chance ability to predict the next turn in a navigational path resembling a previously experienced but unrecalled path (although such resemblance increased reports of déjà vu). However, déjà vu states were accompanied by increased feelings of knowing the direction of the next turn. The results suggest that feelings of premonition during déjà vu occur and can be illusory.

Therefore, people are more sensitive to novelty detection but likely lose flexibility in subsequent novelty processing after detection. To demonstrate the dynamic changes in neural adaption in repeated problem-solving behaviors and test its negative influence on subsequent nonrepetitive problem-solving behaviors, we adopted a Chinese character decomposition task in this fMRI study. Participants were asked to repeatedly perform 3–5 practice problems that could be solved by the same loose chunk decomposition (LCD) solution followed by a test problem that could be solved by a tight chunk decomposition (TCD) solution in the enhanced-set condition. The practice problem gradually elicited lower percent signal changes within the cuneus, superior parietal lobule (SPL), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in serial positions −1, −2 and −3 of a set, implying that neural adaptation occurred in repeated practice. Both the test problem and the practice problem that following it recruited greater activation of the SPL and IFG in the enhanced-set condition than in the base-set condition when the practice problem and test problem alternately appeared, implying that the task switching cost from a more dominant task to a less dominant task and vice versa was increased after neural adaptation occurred. In other words, repeatedly solving a set of similar problems with the same solution likely leads to neural adaptation and cognitive inflexibility, which in turn have an undifferentiated impact on task switching. This finding expands existing knowledge about the neurocognitive mechanism underlying the formation of the mental set and sheds light on the influence of neural adaptation on subsequent processing.",2019-10-01,2020-01-30T07:35:59Z,2020-01-30T07:40:11Z,2020-01-30T07:35:59Z,470-479,NA,119,Cortex,NA,NA,en,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\UYDM88G2\Huang et al. - 2019 - Neural adaptation and cognitive inflexibility in r.pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\WYV8WEDL\S0010945219302874.html,NA,Chunk decomposition; Cognitive inflexibility; Mental set; Neural adaptation; Task switching,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001361,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\UYDM88G2\Huang et al. - 2019 - Neural adaptation and cognitive inflexibility in r.pdf,TRUE

This lack of usage may stem from fears of distorting treatment effects and uncertainty regarding which type to use (e.g., instructional manipulation checks [IMCs] or assessments of whether stimuli alter a latent independent variable of interest). Here, we first categorize the main variants and argue that factual manipulation checks (FMCs)—that is, objective questions about key elements of the experiment—can identify individual-level attentiveness to experimental information and, as a consequence, better enable researchers to diagnose experimental findings. We then find, through four replication studies, little evidence that FMC placement affects treatment effects, and that placing FMCs immediately post-outcome does not attenuate FMC passage rates. Additionally, FMC and IMC passage rates are only weakly related, suggesting that each technique identifies different sets of attentive subjects.

Clinical applications with encouraging results have been reported in several pilot studies, but the optimal stimulation protocols remain to be determined. This is also important because the efficacy and directionality of tDCS effects follow non-linear rules regarding neuroplastic effects for the stimulation parameters duration and intensity. In this study, we systemically explored the association between tDCS, these parameters and induced after-effects on motor cortex excitability. Cathodal tDCS was applied in four different intensities (sham, 1, 2 and 3 mA) and three durations (15, 20 and 30 mins) in 16 young healthy subjects and the after-effects were monitored with TMS-induced motor evoked potentials (MEP) until the next day evening after stimulation. The results of the repeated measures ANOVA conducted to disentangle the effects of tDCS intensity and duration show a main effect of intensity in which 1 mA and 3 mA stimulation induced a reduction of MEP amplitudes, but 2 mA resulted in excitability enhancement. The results of a secondary ANOVA conducted to compare if active stimulation effects differ from those of sham stimulation revealed a significant main effect of tDCS condition in which 1 mA–15 min, 1 mA–30 min and 3 mA–20 min cathodal tDCS induced LTD-like plasticity, while LTP-like plasticity was observed after 2 mA–20 min stimulation.

Specifically, the repeated execution of facial expressions has the opposite effect on the recognition of a subsequent facial expression than the repeated viewing of facial expressions.

We showed that one group of infants (n = 18) readily extended novel labels to previously unseen exemplars of preverbal visual categories after only a single labeling episode, but two other groups struggled to do so when taught labels for unfamiliar categories (those who had been previously exposed, n = 18, or not exposed, n = 18, to category tokens).

Important evidence for this claim comes from studies showing that implicit evaluations do not change as the result of counterattitudinal information, in contrast to their explicit counterparts. We examined the impact of counterattitudinal information on implicit evaluations in two experiments (N = 60, N = 72) that included an innovative manipulation: hypnotic suggestions to participants that they would strongly process upcoming counterattitudinal information. Both experiments indicated that hypnotic suggestions facilitated effects of counterattitudinal information on implicit evaluations.

A nationally representative sample of 1,000 Americans completed a survey, indicating their perceptions of their vulnerability to Ebola, ability to protect themselves from Ebola (protection efficacy), and xenophobic tendencies. Overall, the more vulnerable people felt, the more they exhibited xenophobic responses, but this relationship was moderated by individualism and collectivism. The increase in xenophobia associated with increased vulnerability was especially pronounced among people with high individualism scores and those with low collectivism scores. These relationships were mediated by protection efficacy. State-level collectivism had the same moderating effect on the association between perceived vulnerability and xenophobia that individual-level value orientation did.

We also hypothesised that problems with grounded, concrete contexts would elicit more adequate interpretations than abstract problems. College students (N = 109) interpreted contingency tables in four conditions that varied in symmetry and context. Both factors influenced correct interpretations. A latent class analysis revealed three distinct strategies: (a) compute conditional probabilities (40%), (b) compare-two cells (23%), and (c) anchor and compare (37%), a novel strategy in which reasoners integrate data from all four cells in a stimulus-driven but incorrect way.

Further, the negative effects of incentives hold only when the incentives imply a selfish motive; advocates who are offered a matching incentive (i.e., who are told that the donations they successfully solicit will be matched), which is not incompatible with altruism, perform just as well as those who are not incentivized.

Deviations from study colors were modeled to generate two estimates of color memory: the variability of remembered colors—fidelity—and the probability of forgetting the color. Estimating model parameters using both maximum-likelihood estimation and Bayesian hierarchical modeling, we found that working memory had better fidelity than long-term memory (Experiments 1 and 2).

This manuscript reports direct replications of three key experiments reported by Ottati et al. 2015 in this journal in support of the Earned Dogmatism Hypothesis. Consistent with the original findings, it was found that dogmatic behavior is considered substantially more appropriate for experts relative to novices (d=0.45 [0.35, 0.55] over all replications and original study). In addition, it was confirmed that when participants envision themselves as experts they predict they will be more close-minded (d=−0.54 [−0.64, −0.44]). Unfortunately, replications involving manipulation of expertise through task difficulty showed little to no effect on open-minded cognition (d=0.00 [−0.21, 0.21] for easy/difficult recall task; d=−0.02 [−0.21, 0.17] for easy/difficult trivia task).

Interestingly, there is evidence that the way in which the volume of an object is experienced can affect the strength of the illusion, with a SWI induced by exclusively haptic volume cues feeling stronger than a SWI induced with only visual volume cues. Furthermore, visual cues appear to add nothing over and above haptic size cues in terms of the strength of the induced weight illusion–findings which are difficult to reconcile with work using cue-conflict paradigms where visual cues usually dominate haptic cues. Here, virtual reality was used to place these senses in conflict with one another. Participants (N = 22) judged the heaviness of identically weighted cylinders across three conditions: (1) objects appeared different sizes but were physically the same size, (2) objects were physically different sizes but appeared to be the same size, or (3) objects which looked and felt different sizes from one another. Consistent with prior work, haptic size cues induced a larger SWI than that induced by visual size differences. In contrast to prior work, however, congruent vision and haptic size cues yielded a larger still SWI. These findings not only add to our understanding of how different modalities combine to influence our hedonic perception but also showcase how virtual reality can develop novel cue-conflict paradigms.",2019-09-01,2020-02-05T06:17:58Z,2020-02-05T06:18:12Z,2020-02-05T06:17:58Z,2168-2175,9,72,Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology,NA,NA,en,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\3PR9LT3K\Buckingham - 2019 - Examining the size–weight illusion with visuo-hapt.pdf,NA,NA,Virtual reality; heaviness perception; illusions,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001397,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\3PR9LT3K\Buckingham - 2019 - Examining the size–weight illusion with visuo-hapt.pdf,TRUE

Four studies (and an internal meta-analysis) tested the idea that receiving a generous gift from someone higher in perceived socioeconomic status (SES) signals social identity threat. In Study 1 (N = 218), participants on average, but especially those with relatively lower SES, reported experiencing more self-conscious negative affect when receiving a generous amount of money (vs. an even split) from a higher status giver in a dictator game. This effect was mediated by feeling pitied by the giver. Studies 2 (N = 331) and 3 (N = 426) revealed similar effects with recalled real-world experiences of receiving a generous gift from higher SES givers. Studies 3 and 4 (N = 142) revealed evidence for serial mediation, with lower relative SES predicting status awareness, status awareness predicting attributions of pity, and attributions of pity in turn predicting self-conscious negative affect. Effects were not significantly moderated by needing or requesting the money, suggesting that acts of generosity across the status divide readily signal social devaluation for those with lower perceived status.

However, interpretation can be tricky given that different choices for centering model predictors can lead to different versions of what appear to be the same parameters; this is especially the case when the predictors are latent variables created through model-estimated variance components. A further complication is a recent change to Mplus (Version 8.1), a popular software program for estimating multivariate multilevel models, in which the selection of Bayesian estimation instead of maximum likelihood results in different lower-level predictors when random slopes are requested. This article provides a detailed explication of how the parameters of multilevel models differ as a function of the analyst’s decisions regarding centering and the form of lower-level predictors (i.e., observed or latent), the method of estimation, and the variant of program syntax used. After explaining how different methods of centering lower-level observed predictor variables result in different higher-level effects within univariate multilevel models, this article uses simulated data to demonstrate how these same concepts apply in specifying multivariate multilevel models with latent lower-level predictor variables.

Here we show that multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) of early diffusion-weighted lesion maps can be used to accurately predict long-term recovery of tactile object recognition (TOR) in 35 subjects with varying hand skill impairment and associated specific daily activity limitation after cortical sensori-motor stroke. Multiple regression analysis revealed the essentially dysfunctional subprocesses for object recognition in the specifically impaired subjects, i.e., grasping as determined by a subtest of Jebsen Taylor hand function test, and perception of macrogeometrical object properties. The Gaussian process regression of MVPA represents a function that relates a selection of lesioned voxels as input variables to TOR performance scores as target variables. On the behavioural level, patients fell into three recovery subgroups, depending on TOR performance over the observation period. Only baseline motor hand skill and shape discrimination were significantly correlated with the TOR trajectories. To define functionally meaningful voxels, we combined information from MVPA of lesion maps and a priori knowledge of regions of interest derived from a data bank for shape recognition. A high significance for the predicted TOR performances over nine months could be verified by permutation tests, leading us to expect that the model generalises to larger patient cohorts with first cortical ischemic stroke. The lesion sites of the persistently impaired subjects exhibited an overlap with critical areas related to the MVPA prediction map in the cytoarchitectonic areas PFt of inferior parietal lobule and OP1 of parietal operculum which are associated with higher order sensory processing. This ultimate check corroborated the significance of the MVPA map for the prediction of tactile object recognition. The clinical implication of our study is that neuroimaging data acquired immediately after first stroke could facilitate individual forecasting of post-stroke recovery.",2019-06-01,2020-01-30T07:01:49Z,2020-01-30T07:02:09Z,2020-01-30T07:01:49Z,264-279,NA,115,Cortex,NA,NA,en,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\2VEYA5U9\Abela et al. - 2019 - Early prediction of long-term tactile object recog.pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\4CIUIZ78\S0010945219300383.html,NA,Cortical sensorimotor stroke; Multi-voxel pattern analysis; Neuronal network for shape recognition; Prediction; Tactile object recognition (TOR),TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001408,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\2VEYA5U9\Abela et al. - 2019 - Early prediction of long-term tactile object recog.pdf,TRUE

To supplement previously published datasets, we report two novel experiments: Experiment 1 (n = 12) found null effects of adaptation to 10° leftward prisms on spatial bias in the landmark task, and Experiment 2 (n = 24) found null effects of 12° leftward prisms on spatial bias in a computerised line bisection task. Including these data, we considered 17 experiments for the landmark task (total n = 256), and 12 experiments for line bisection (total n = 172), in which participants were adapted for between 7 and 20 min to prism strengths from 8 to 17°. A random-effects meta-analysis, with prism strength and exposure duration as moderators, confirmed robust rightward shifts in visuospatial judgements following leftward prism adaptation. The average standardised effect sizes (Cohen's d) were similar between tasks, increasing by around .1 per degree of prismatic displacement, and being boosted by a long (10 min +) period of prism exposure. However, the quality of evidence and precision of prediction was superior for the landmark task, with a higher signal-to-noise ratio within studies, and less heterogeneity between studies. We suggest that line bisection responses may be contaminated by sensorimotor aftereffects, and that the landmark task is a more suitable method for measuring true visuospatial aftereffects of prism adaptation. To harness these effects, we recommend that researchers should expose participants to 15° (or higher) leftward prisms for more than ten minutes, with upwards of 250 pointing movements.

In this article, we revive an older literature that emphasizes the appeal of these parties’ religious nature to voters experiencing economic hardship. Individuals suffering economic strain may vote for Islamists because they believe this to be an intrinsically virtuous act that will be met with divine rewards in the afterlife. We explore this hypothesis through a series of laboratory experiments in Tunisia. Individuals assigned to treatment conditions instilling feelings of economic strain exhibit greater support for Islamist parties, and this support is causally mediated by an expectation of divine compensation in the hereafter.

The four words included either the target word (e.g., 魚 /sakana/; fish), an orthographic competitor (e.g., 角 /tuno/; horn), a phonological competitor (e.g., 桜 /sakura/; cherry blossom), or an unrelated word (e.g., 本 /hon/; book), together with three distractor words. The orthographic competitor was orthographically or phonologically dissimilar to the target in hiragana. In Experiment 1, target and orthographic competitor words attracted more fixations than unrelated words before the target word was mentioned, suggesting that participants pre-activated orthographic form of the target word. In Experiment 2, target and phonological competitor words attracted more predictive fixations than unrelated words, but orthographic competitor words did not, suggesting a critical role of the visual context.

Specifically, low-SES students' desire to persist on a primary path to mobility (i.e., school) should remain strong if they believe that socioeconomic mobility can occur in their society. By contrast, those who believe that socioeconomic mobility generally does not occur should be less motivated to persist academically.

Observers of this kind of behavior have been shown to react negatively in such situations, and in extreme cases, may even leave their group. The current work set out to test how this reaction might be prevented. We assumed that group-norm affirmations can buffer leaving intentions in response to group-norm violations and tested three potential mechanisms underlying the buffering effect of group-norm affirmations. To this end, we conducted three experiments in which we manipulated group-norm violations and group-norm affirmations. In Study 1, we found group-norm affirmations to buffer leaving intentions after group-norm violations. However, we did not find support for the assumption that group-norm affirmations change how a behavior is evaluated or preserve group members' identification with their group. Thus, neither of these variables can explain the buffering effect of group-norm affirmations. Studies 2 & 3 revealed that group-norm affirmations instead reduce perceived effectiveness of the norm-violator, which in turn predicted lower leaving intentions.

By coding nonverbal behaviors displayed in political speeches, we assessed the virtues and vices of 151 U.S. senators. We found that virtuous senators became more influential after they assumed leadership roles, whereas senators who displayed behaviors consistent with vices—particularly psychopathy—became no more influential or even less influential after they assumed leadership roles.

To date, only a very small fraction of these data have been digitized as part of the MIDAS dataset, and exclusively after 1950. Using the recently-scanned UK Met Office Monthly Weather Reports (MWR), which are based on a subset of the observations that form the DWR, we here provide digitized data and a summary of thunderdays from 10 long-running British stations over the period 1884–1993. The data are presented ‘as is’, with no attempt to provide any corrections or calibration. For 4 of the 10 stations, thunderday observations were discontinued at various times between 1949 and 1964, and it is necessary to switch to a neighbouring station in order to continue the series. Approximately half the series exhibit sharp drops in thunderdays at various points between 1960 and 1990, although none are coincident with known station changes. Comparison with nearby MIDAS stations suggests the low thunderdays are the result of changes in observing practice, rather than genuine changes in thunderstorm occurrence. These potential data issues limit interpretation of the long-term trends. However, it can nevertheless be concluded that none of the stations show the expected increase in thunderdays as a result of the rise in surface temperature over the 20th century.

In contrast, groups collectively high in testosterone, which is associated with a heightened status drive, would be derailed by diversity. Analysis of 74 randomly assigned groups engaged in a group decision-making exercise provided support for these hypotheses.

We extend this research by moving beyond depletion to examine a more nuanced, process-based view of self-control. We draw on integrative self-control theory (Kotabe & Hofmann, 2015) to identify two critical moderators of the relationship between sleep and unethical behavior. Whereas prior research has focused mainly on the deleterious effects associated with depleted control capacity – such as sleep deprivation – we suggest that factors influencing control motivation and control effort are also an essential part of the self-regulatory process. First, we examine the role of control motivation, hypothesizing that a perceived sense of power moderates the relationship between sleep deprivation and depletion by motivating agentic, goal-directed action that mitigates the depleting effect of sleep deprivation. Second, we consider the role of control effort, hypothesizing that contemplation moderates the relationship between depletion and unethical behavior, such that depleted individuals are less likely to act unethically when contemplation is high.

Does this reflect the indirect effects of a passively maintained representation of the previous experience, or is this representation reactivated when a new event occurs? To answer this question, we attempted to decode the orientation of the stimulus on the previous trial from the electroencephalogram on the current trial in a working memory task. Behavioral data confirmed that the previous-trial stimulus orientation influenced the reported orientation on the current trial, even though the previous-trial orientation was now task irrelevant. In two independent experiments, we found that the previous-trial orientation could be decoded from the current-trial electroencephalogram, indicating that the current-trial stimulus reactivated or boosted the representation of the previous-trial orientation.

We theorized—on the basis of simulations using a value-normalization model—that indulgent common consequences potentiated disciplined choices by shaping other options’ perceived healthfulness and tastiness. Our experimental results confirmed these predictions: An indulgent common consequence more than doubled the rate of disciplined choices. We used eye-gaze data to provide insights into the underlying mechanisms, finding that an indulgent common consequence biased eye gaze toward healthful foods. Furthermore, attention toward the common consequence predicted individual differences in behavioral bias. Results were replicated across two independent samples receiving distinct goal primes.

Electroencephalographic recordings (CSD estimate), revealed the sequence of cortical activities that lead, or not, to conscious detection. Besides medio-prefrontal activities related to action monitoring and error detection, the motor command sent by the primary motor cortices also differed between detected and undetected partial errors: while it develops identically, it is stopped earlier for the latter than for the former, suggesting a critical role in partial error detection. Second, the analysis of the “Error positivity” – Pe, classically linked to error awareness, confirmed its absence just after partial errors, be they detected or not.

Specifically, stimulation of the motor representation associated with the unchosen response reduced confidence in correct responses, thereby reducing metacognitive capacity without changing visual discrimination performance. Effects of TMS on confidence were observed when stimulation was applied both before and after the response occurred, which suggests that confidence depends on late-stage metacognitive processes.

In two studies, we showed that exposure to exemplary peer performances can undermine motivation and success by causing people to perceive that they cannot attain their peers’ high levels of performance. It also causes de-identification with the relevant domain. We examined such discouragement by peer excellence by exploiting the incidental exposure to peers’ abilities that occurs when students are asked to assess each other’s work.

This study investigated interpretation bias and inflexibility in relation to depression severity and social anxiety. Participants (N = 212) completed a novel cognitive task that simultaneously measured bias and inflexibility in the interpretation of unfolding ambiguous situations. Depression severity was associated with increased negative and decreased positive interpretation biases. Social anxiety was associated with increased negative interpretation bias. Critically, both symptom types were related to reduced revision of negative interpretations by disconfirmatory positive information. These findings suggest that individuals with more severe depression or social anxiety make more biased and inflexible interpretations.

Some evidence suggests that the amount of available information is positively related to accuracy. The current study utilized the social accuracy model to investigate the effects of differences in thin slices of information quantity on the distinctive accuracy and normativity of personality trait judgments. It was hypothesized that distinctive accuracy and normativity would increase as information quantity increased. Participants were 431 individuals who participated in an online study that varied the length of stimulus target observations (30 seconds, 1 minute, 3 minutes, and 5 minutes), after which judges rated targets using other-report measures of the Big Five personality traits. For all traits combined, significant levels of accuracy were found for all observation lengths, but distinctive accuracy and normativity did not increase as video length increased. Findings varied for individual traits. For distinctive accuracy, there was a linear increase with information quantity for Extraversion and a non-linear relationship for Conscientiousness, while there was a linear decrease for Openness. For normativity, there was a linear increase with information quantity for Agreeableness and a non-linear relationship for Conscientiousness.

We explored how these mimicry components affected liking and metaperceptions of liking (i.e., metaliking). Employing social relations models, we found substantial interindividual differences in imitativity, which predicted popularity.

Current interpretations of this post-boundary preview difficulty effect range from delayed parafoveal-on-foveal effects in parallel word-processing models to forced fixations in serial word-processing models. However, these findings are based on an experimental design that, while allowing to isolate preview difficulty effects, might have established a bias with respect to asymmetries in parafoveal preview benefit for high-frequent and low-frequent target words. Here, we present a revision of this paradigm varying the preview’s lexical frequency and keeping the target word constant. We found substantial effects of the preview difficulty in fixation durations after the boundary confirming that preview processing affects the oculomotor decisions not only via trans-saccadic integration of preview and target word information. An additional time-course analysis showed that the preview difficulty effect was significant across the full fixation duration distribution on the target word without any evidence on the pretarget word before the boundary.

They performed a standard contingency learning task, which can be used to detect causal illusions. Participants who performed the task in their native tongue replicated the illusion of causality effect, whereas those performing the task in their foreign language were more accurate in detecting that the two events were causally unrelated. Our results suggest that presenting the information in a foreign language could be used as a strategy to debias individuals against causal illusions, thereby facilitating more accurate judgements and decisions in non-contingent situations.

Can states of hunger and satiety play the role of context? In two experiments, rats learned a food-seeking response that earned sucrose or sweet, fatty food pellets while they were satiated. Responding was then inhibited (i.e., extinguished) while the rats were hungry. On the rats’ return to the satiated state, their food seeking was renewed. Additional results suggest that associations with hunger or satiety stimuli were learned more readily than associations with other potentially useful exteroceptive stimuli.

Effects of spatial compatibility are usually explained by a match or mismatch of automatic behavioural tendencies and intentional mapping processes. The question is whether actors develop such behavioural tendencies for an avatar and thereby are able to neglect their own perspective. In the experiments, actors take the perspective of the avatar and pressed ipsilateral or contralateral left–right keys in response to lateralised coloured discs. Experiments 1 and 2 showed that compatibility effects are tied to the avatar but not to the actor. Experiment 3 revealed that participants could ignore the perspective of the avatar.

Our reanalysis (N = 4,842) indicates that individual biases did not return to preexisting levels. Instead, campus means returned to preexisting campus means, whereas individual scores fluctuated mostly randomly. Campus means were predicted by markers of structural inequality.

These relations divide continuous space into discrete categories, such as “above” and “below,” or “containing” and “overlapping,” which are remembered and compared more easily than precise metric values. These relations should lead to categorical perception, such that viewers find it easier to notice a change that crosses a category boundary (one object is now above, rather than below, another, or now contains, rather than overlaps with, another) than a change of equal magnitude that does not cross a boundary. We tested the influence of a set of topological categorical relations from the cognitive-modeling literature.

Although several explanations of this phenomenon have been proposed, we identify an overlooked asymmetry in information about new and old items that emerges when people seek positive experiences and learn about the qualities of (noisy) alternatives by experiencing them. The reason for the asymmetry is that people avoid rechoosing alternatives that previously led to poor outcomes; hence, additional feedback on their qualities is precluded. Negative quality estimates, even when caused by noise, thus tend to persist. This negative bias takes time to develop, and affects old alternatives more strongly than similar but newer alternatives. We analyze a simple learning model and demonstrate the process by which people would tend to evaluate a new alternative more positively than an older alternative with the same payoff distribution.

The critical factor to utilize this paradigm is inducing a labile state of the long-term memory. Novel information is viewed as a driving factor to update memory; however, it is unknown whether different forms of novelty play the same role. In addition, although pharmacological intervention studies have confirmed that prediction error (PE) during reactivation is a necessary condition in memory destabilization, the role of PE in retrieval extinction has remained under debate; furthermore, the neural mechanisms underlying the process are largely unknown. In this study, we isolated two forms of novelty: PE and stimulus novelty without PE during reactivation to compare their role in memory lability. Skin conductance responses (SCR) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) were used to clarify their role at the behavioural and neural mechanism levels. A total of 54 healthy adults were tested in a three-day retrieval extinction protocol. The results showed that PE, the novelty of CS-US combinations, was a critical condition to destabilize memory. The novelty of the stimulus itself with the absence of PE was insufficient for retrieving the memory. The neural mechanisms that distinguished standard extinction from retrieval extinction were that the latter was associated with a diminished recruitment of the inferior temporal cortex (IT) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and decreased functional connectivity of the dlPFC-anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and IT-dlPFC.

A large body of research has implicated left parietal regions in symbolic number processing. One possible explanation for this lateralization of neural activity is the handedness of participants. Specifically, participants in neuroimaging research are almost exclusively right-handed. The current study sought to probe whether number representation in the brain is associated with hand preference for handwriting. To address this question, we used functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to compare brain activation of a group of right-handed participants with a group of left-handed participants during the passive viewing of symbolic numbers. At the whole-brain level, the right-handers demonstrated a previously obtained left-lateralized effect within the intraparietal sulcus (IPS). The left-handers showed some evidence of reverse lateralization of this effect in the IPS. However, when the groups were statistically compared, we found no regions that demonstrated group-level differences. In a follow-up region of interest (ROI) analysis within the left and right parietal lobes, we calculated laterality indices for each participant. Results did not provide support for group differences in laterality within the right or left IPS ROI. These findings do not support the hypothesis that handwriting plays a role in the lateralization of symbolic number processing in the brain.

Because we measure both preferences and policies on the same scale (U.S. dollars), we can quantify both the association of policy outcomes with preferences across states (responsiveness) and their deviation within states (bias). We demonstrate that while minimum wages respond to corresponding preferences across states, policy outcomes are more conservative than preferences in each state, with the average policy bias amounting to about two dollars.

Here, we demonstrate how liquid mixtures are categorized in ways characteristic of hypodescent.

However, the evidence for self-insight was weaker for agreeableness.

The present research proposes that poor health might represent both a consequence and a source of cynicism. Using cross-lagged path analyses, we documented bidirectional associations between health and cynicism in a nationally representative sample of Germans (Study 1) and a large sample of the American elderly (Study 2): cynical individuals were more likely to develop health problems, and poor health promoted the development of a cynical worldview over time. These results were obtained using different indicators of health status, including both self-reported and interviewer-administered physical measures. Longitudinal mediation analyses showed perceived constraints to mediate the effect of poor health on cynicism. This effect remained robust even when adding an alternative mediator—depressive symptoms. Additional analyses showed that any particular health limitation was prospectively related to cynicism to the degree to which this limitation was associated with an increased sense of constraints in individuals' life. © 2018 The Authors.

Home country institutions shape firms' practices and capabilities, thus helping to determine the environments that firms are best prepared to face abroad. We test our predictions using multiple data sets at different levels of analysis: firm-level data on MNEs' foreign subsidiaries, data on bilateral foreign direct investment (FDI) positions, and longitudinal data on bilateral FDI flows. We find that states with independent judiciaries are particularly attractive to investment from countries also possessing independent courts. Similarly, countries with low judicial independence disproportionately send FDI to countries lacking independent judiciaries.

Here, we demonstrated the phenomenon of vicarious optimism and showed that it arises from concern for others.

In addition to showing an optimistic learning bias for events affecting themselves, people showed vicarious optimism when learning about events affecting friends and strangers.

On the basis of the inaction-effect bias, we theorized that negative feedback results in the tendency to take action, regardless of what that action may be. In four experiments, we demonstrated that people facing escalation-decision situations were indeed action oriented and that framing escalation as action and de-escalation as inaction resulted in a stronger tendency to escalate than framing de-escalation as action and escalation as inaction (mini-meta-analysis effect d = 0.37, 95% confidence interval = [0.21, 0.53]).",2018-04,2019-04-06T17:45:30Z,2019-04-06T17:45:42Z,2019-04-06T17:45:30Z,537-548,4,29,NA,When Action-Inaction Framing Leads to Higher Escalation of Commitment,NA,en,NA,Crossref,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\T74STKP9\Feldman en Wong - 2018 - When Action-Inaction Framing Leads to Higher Escal.pdf,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,2018,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,a001502,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\T74STKP9\Feldman en Wong - 2018 - When Action-Inaction Framing Leads to Higher Escal.pdf,TRUE

Based on its results, we conducted a pre-registered confirmatory study (N = 264) focusing on the most promising correlations found in our exploratory study. This study generated conclusive support for a positive medium-sized correlation between cognitive flexibility and pro-environmental behaviour. Exploratory hierarchical regression analyses further revealed that cognitive flexibility accounted for a small portion of variance in pro-environmental behaviour above and beyond the Big Five. While appearing robust on the level of self-reports, the relationship between cognitive flexibility and pro-environmental behaviour did not reliably extend to the level of performance tasks, possibly because of their relatively specific scope.

Across five experiments (N = 67), we found that thought-control failure may occur because of the involuntary and antithetical formation of nonreportable sensory representations during attempts at thought suppression but not during thought substitution.

Results showed that women rated another woman lower on uniquely human personality traits when she was dressed in a sexualized (vs. conventional) manner. Lower humanness ratings subsequently predicted increased aggression toward her in a behavioral measure of aggression. This effect was moderated by trait intrasexual competitiveness; lower humanness ratings translated into more aggression, but only for women scoring relatively high on intrasexual competition.

We predicted that reconsolidation of a reactivated visual memory of experimental trauma could be disrupted by engaging in a visuospatial task that would compete for visual working memory resources. We showed that intrusive memories were virtually abolished by playing the computer game Tetris following a memory-reactivation task 24 hr after initial exposure to experimental trauma. Furthermore, both memory reactivation and playing Tetris were required to reduce subsequent intrusions (Experiment 2), consistent with reconsolidation-update mechanisms.

We show that the ability of these models to adjust for unobserved time-invariant confounders comes at the expense of dynamic causal relationships, which are permitted under an alternative selection-on-observables approach. Using the nonparametric directed acyclic graph, we highlight two key causal identification assumptions of unit fixed effects models: Past treatments do not directly influence current outcome, and past outcomes do not affect current treatment. Furthermore, we introduce a new nonparametric matching framework that elucidates how various unit fixed effects models implicitly compare treated and control observations to draw causal inference. By establishing the equivalence between matching and weighted unit fixed effects estimators, this framework enables a diverse set of identification strategies to adjust for unobservables in the absence of dynamic causal relationships between treatment and outcome variables.

A total of 21 patients with schizophrenia and 21 age-, gender-, and IQ-matched healthy controls completed an interactive computer game with an on-screen avatar that participants believed was controlled by an off-screen partner. On social trials, participants were required to achieve joint attention by correctly interpreting and responding to gaze cues. Participants also completed non-social trials in which they responded to an arrow cue within the same task context. While patients and controls took equivalent time to process communicative intent from gaze shifts, patients made significantly more errors than controls when responding to the directional information conveyed by gaze, but not arrow, cues. Despite no differences in response times to gaze cues between groups, patients were significantly slower than controls when responding to arrow cues. This is the opposite pattern of results previously observed in autistic adults using the same task and suggests that, despite general impairments in attention orienting or oculomotor control, patients with schizophrenia demonstrate a facilitation effect when responding to communicative gaze cues.

Participants with a disability (N = 502) completed online, self-report measures of need to belong, sense of belonging, social support, and positive disability identity. As expected, those who perceived greater social support were more likely to report a sense of belonging (r ranged from .36 to .55, p < .05) and positive disability identity (r ranged from .18 to .41, p < .05). Positive disability identity was more strongly related to sense of belonging in those who self-identify with a disability (z = 4.16, p < .001, Cohen’s q = .40).

However, they are limited by the difficulty of disambiguating brain activity required to perform a tic, or activity caused by the tic, from brain activity that generates a tic. Inhibiting ticcing following the urge to tic is important to patients' experience of tics and we hypothesize that inhibition of a compelling motor response to a natural urge will differ in TS subjects compared to controls. This study examines the urge to blink, which shares many similarities to premonitory urges to tic. Previous neuroimaging studies with the same hypothesis have used a one-size-fits-all approach to extract brain signal putatively linked to the urge to blink. We aimed to create a subject-specific and blink-timing-specific pathophysiological model, derived from out-of-scanner blink suppression trials, to eventually better interpret blink suppression fMRI data. Eye closure and continuously self-reported discomfort were reported during five blink suppression trials in 30 adult volunteers, 15 with a chronic tic disorder. For each subject, data from four of the trials were used with an empirical mathematical model to predict discomfort from eye closure observed during the remaining trial. The blink timing model of discomfort during blink suppression predicted observed discomfort much better than previously applied models. Combining this approach with observed eye closure during fMRI blink suppression trials should therefore extract brain signal more tightly linked to the urge to blink. The simple mean of time-discomfort curves from each subject's other trials also outperformed older models. The TS group blinked more than twice as often during the blink suppression block, and reported higher baseline discomfort, smaller excursion from baseline to peak discomfort during the blink suppression block, and slower return of discomfort to baseline during the recovery block.",2019-11-01,2020-01-30T07:51:58Z,2020-01-30T11:09:41Z,2020-01-30T07:51:58Z,556-566,NA,120,Cortex,NA,NA,en,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\YM7CAKPB\Botteron et al. - 2019 - The urge to blink in Tourette syndrome.pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\SX2QPLWG\S0010945219302667.html,NA,Blinking; Inhibition (psychology); Tic disorders; Tourette syndrome; Urge,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001539,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\YM7CAKPB\Botteron et al. - 2019 - The urge to blink in Tourette syndrome.pdf,TRUE

However, the phase synchronization has been rarely considered in previous studies related to climate and biogeography due to a lack of a robust and quantitative approach. In this study, we proposed a synchronization index of temperature and precipitation (SI-TaP) and then investigated its global spatial distribution, interannual fluctuation, and long-term trend derived from a global 60-year dataset of meteorological forcings. Further investigation was conducted to understand the relationship between SI-TaP and the annually summed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), which could be a proxy of terrestrial vegetation productivity. Results show differences in both spatial patterns and temporal variations between SI-TaP and air temperature and precipitation, but SI-TaP may help to explain the distribution and productivity of terrestrial vegetation. About 60% of regions where annually summed NDVI is greater than half of its maximum value overlap regions where SI-TaP is greater than half of its maximum value. By using SI-TaP to explain vegetation productivity along with temperature and precipitation, the maximum increase in the coefficient of determination is 0.66 across global lands.

Our research replicated and extended previous studies examining the limits of gestures in learning L2 vocabulary.

We have shown that professional freestyle swimmers at relay positions 2 to 4 swam faster in the relay than in the individual competition if they had a high chance to win a relay medal. After applying a reaction-time correction that controls for different starting procedures in relay and individual competitions, Skorski et al. (2016) conclude that swimmers in relays do not swim faster. At first sight, their results appear to show this very pattern. However, we argue that the authors’ findings and conclusion—that our finding is a myth—are not warranted. First, we have also controlled for quicker reaction times in the relay competition. Our correction has been based on the swimmers’ own reaction time data rather than on a constant reaction time estimate and is, thus, more precise than theirs. Second, Skorski et al. treat data from international and national competitions equally although national relay competitions are less attractive for the swimmers than national individual competitions. This difference likely biases their data towards slower relay times. Third, the authors select a small and arbitrary sample without explicit power considerations or a clear stopping rule. Fourth, they unfavorably aggregate their data.

We then externally validated models in a community clinic (N = 511) with the same candidate predictors and semistructured interview diagnoses, providing high methodological consistency; the clinics also had substantially different demography and referral patterns. Models performed well according to internal validation metrics. Complex models degraded rapidly when externally validated.

Our results indicate that responses to hypothetical dilemmas are not predictive of real-life dilemma behavior, but they are predictive of affective and cognitive aspects of the real-life decision. Furthermore, participants were twice as likely to refrain from shocking the single mouse when confronted with a hypothetical versus the real version of the dilemma.

We present a series of experiments that investigate how people decode the physical form of an articulator to derive imaginary geometrical constructs, which we call “gesture form.” We provide quantitative evidence for several key properties that play a role in this process. First, “profiling,” the ability to focus on a structural subunit within the complex form of the physical hand. Second, “perspective,” for which we show that one and the same handshape seen from different perspectives can lead to different spatial interpretations.

While having widespread theoretical and intuitive appeal, this notion has barely been tested empirically. We used a recently developed paradigm to test whether severely corrupt acts happen gradually or abruptly. The results of four experimental studies revealed a higher likelihood of severe corruption when participants were directly given the opportunity to engage in it (abrupt) compared with when they had previously engaged in minor forms of corruption (gradual).

People's willingness and capacity to empathize, however, is often contingent upon the target's group membership – people are less empathic towards those they categorize as out-group members. In competitive or threatening intergroup contexts, people may even feel pleasure (counter-empathy) in response to out-group members' misfortunes. Social dominance orientation (SDO), or the extent to which people prefer and promote group-based inequalities, is an ideological variable that is associated with a competitive view of the world, increased prejudicial attitudes, and decreased empathy. Thus, higher levels of SDO should be associated with reduced empathy and increased counter-empathy in general, but especially towards those whose subjugation maintains group inequalities. Across three studies we show that among White individuals, higher SDO levels are associated with less empathy, and more counter-empathy in response to others' good and bad fortunes. More importantly, these reductions in empathy and increases in schadenfreude as a function of SDO were significantly stronger for Asian and Black targets than for in-group White targets when group boundaries were made salient prior to the empathy ratings. Finally, in a fourth study we show that this phenomenon is not dependent upon a history of status differences: higher SDO scores were associated with decreased empathy and increased counter-empathy for competitive out-group (relative to in-group) targets in a novel group setting. We discuss implications of these effects for hierarchy maintenance.",2019-11-01,2020-02-06T01:59:14Z,2020-02-10T04:08:24Z,2020-02-06T01:59:14Z,103871,NA,85,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,NA,NA,en,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\YMJASXCZ\Hudson et al. - 2019 - Preference for hierarchy is associated with reduce.pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\N3ZTEKN4\S0022103119303087.html,NA,Empathy; Race; Schadenfreude; Social dominance orientation,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001571,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\YMJASXCZ\Hudson et al. - 2019 - Preference for hierarchy is associated with reduce.pdf,TRUE

We used the association between the concrete (spatial) and abstract (ideological) components of the political left-right metaphor to demonstrate that metaphorical conflict has marked implications for cognitive processing and social perception. Specifically, we showed that creating conflict between a spatial location and a metaphorically linked concept reduces perceived differences between the attitudes of partisans who are generally viewed as possessing fundamentally different worldviews (Democrats and Republicans). We further demonstrated that metaphorical conflict reduces perceived attitude differences by creating a mind-set in which categories are represented as possessing broader boundaries than when concepts are metaphorically compatible. These results suggest that metaphorical conflict shapes social perception by making members of distinct groups appear more similar than they are generally thought to be.

Although a large number of studies have investigated approach and avoidance elicited by specific sensory stimuli, comparatively little is known about default approach biases when stimulus information is absent or reduced. The amygdala is well known to contribute to approach and avoidance behaviors in response to specific sensory stimuli; we tested whether the amygdala’s role might extend to situations in which stimulus information is reduced. In a novel task, 3 patients with rare bilateral amygdala lesions (and control subjects) made approach-related judgments about photos of intact faces and of the same faces with all internal facial features occluded. Direct comparisons of the judgments of these stimuli isolated a default bias. The patients showed a greater tendency than the control subjects to rate occluded faces as more approachable than whole faces.

However, it is not known whether this preference is specific to faces or reflects a more generalised preference in biological stimuli: for example, non-face body parts. Moreover, it is not yet well established whether the preference for carotenoid colouration extends beyond Caucasian populations. Three studies were conducted to address these issues. In Studies 1 and 2, Caucasian and Hong Kong Chinese participants, respectively, selected the more attractive image in pairs of high and low carotenoid colouration versions of images of Caucasian faces and body parts, and also for non-face/body-part control stimuli (scrambled faces). In Study 3, a similar study protocol was used with an independent sample of Hong Kong Chinese participants using stimuli generated from Chinese individuals. The results showed that high carotenoid colouration was preferred across all the three studies in faces and body parts, but not in the control stimuli. In addition, there was a stronger preference for high carotenoid colouration in faces compared with body parts in Studies 1 and 2—although this preference was not observed in Study 3.

Here, we tested how this ability to coordinate comprehension and production develops in preschool children. In an interactive paradigm, 106 children (ages 3–5 years) and 48 adults responded to questions that varied in predictability but were controlled for linguistic complexity. Using a novel distributional approach to data analysis, we found that when children can predict a question’s ending, they leave shorter gaps before responding, suggesting that they can optimize the timing of their conversational turns like adults do.

A correlational study (N = 201) found that people high in trait self-control had done more planning than other people and also intended to make more plans during the upcoming week. A laboratory experiment (N = 105) induced a state of ego depletion (i.e., impaired self-control) by having some participants continuously break pre-established motoric habits, and afterward these participants were less willing to make plans for the next four weeks than control participants. A field experiment (N = 112) used a naturally occurring induction of decision fatigue (IKEA shopping) and again found that ego depletion reduced planning. Specifically, fatigued shoppers exiting the store expressed more reluctance to make long-term plans than shoppers who were just arriving at the store. A final laboratory experiment (N = 128) found that ego-depleted participants were only half as likely to choose a planning task as control participants, and identified effort avoidance as a mediator mechanism. Crucially, the three experimental manipulations were longer and stronger than the 5-min depletion tasks often used in previous research (24 min; 2 h; 30 min), and manipulation checks confirmed severe and significant ego depletion. Depletion had no effects on aspirational goals or the desire to relax. We conclude that wants and desires come easily, while planning requires mental work akin to self-control.

Being able to overcome such conflicts is a necessary prerequisite in everyday life, because it enables goal-directed behavior. On a conceptual level, different kinds of conflict can be distinguished: conflicts at a stimulus level (S-S conflicts) can be dissociated from stimulus-response (S-R) conflicts. Considering cognitive psychological frameworks, we examined whether simultaneously presented conflicts potentiate each other, or are rather integrated into a single conflict. To assess the neurophysiological mechanisms and functional neuroanatomical structures that are modulated by independent, interfering or integrative processing of conflicts, we use a Simon-Stroop paradigm in combination with EEG recordings and source localization. We show that S-R (Simon) conflict monitoring processes reflected by anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and N2 ERP component modulations are unaffected by simultaneous S-S (Stroop) conflicts. In contrast to that, S-S (Stroop) conflicts, reflected in N450 ERP component and ACC modulations are not processed separately when there is an already existing S-R conflict. Rather, S-S (Stroop) conflicts are likely integrated into previously established S-R conflict resolution and also modulate response selection processes associated with the modulation of the P3 ERP component and dorsolateral prefrontal structures. The results suggest that even though different kinds of conflicts can be distinguished, they can become integrated during neural processing associated with medial frontal areas.",2019-06-01,2020-01-30T07:02:16Z,2020-01-30T07:02:35Z,2020-01-30T07:02:16Z,216-230,NA,115,Cortex,NA,NA,en,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\TLLVJ4Y8\Chmielewski and Beste - 2019 - Neurophysiological mechanisms underlying the modul.pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\J4IQTKX8\S0010945219300589.html,NA,Conflict monitoring; EEG; Simon; Source localization; Stroop; Theory of event coding,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001585,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\TLLVJ4Y8\Chmielewski and Beste - 2019 - Neurophysiological mechanisms underlying the modul.pdf,TRUE

Results showed that successfully avoiding biased responding on conflict items across both age groups was associated with increased activation in Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC) and the right Lateral Prefrontal Cortex (LPFC) regions of interest. Critically, the right LPFC activation decreased with age. Biased responding did not result in right LPFC or ACC modulation and failed to show any developmental activation changes. We discuss implications for ongoing debates on the nature of heuristic bias and its development.",2019-08-01,2020-01-30T07:14:49Z,2020-01-30T07:15:14Z,2020-01-30T07:14:49Z,111-121,NA,117,Cortex,NA,NA,en,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\7255YSL5\Mevel et al. - 2019 - Developmental frontal brain activation differences.pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\ZE7PURQQ\S0010945219301091.html,NA,Development; Reasoning; Inhibition; Cognitive control; fMRI; Heuristics & biases,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001594,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\7255YSL5\Mevel et al. - 2019 - Developmental frontal brain activation differences.pdf,TRUE

An important finding for theory and intervention is that children’s inhibitory control improves if an adult imposes a delay before they can act. Such findings have suggested that the passage of time allows impulsive urges to dissipate passively. However, in prior studies with imposed delays, children were also reminded about what they should be doing, which may have aided their activation of goal-relevant information. We tested this possibility by independently manipulating delays and task reminders, and measuring 3-year-olds’ abilities to inhibit opening boxes in a go/no-go box-search task. Task reminders, but not adult-imposed delays, improved children’s response inhibition. However, as in prior work, children who spontaneously delayed their action longer on go trials exhibited better response inhibition on no-go trials.

Based on pluralist theory, one can expect diverse coalitions, uniting different societal interests, to signal broad support to policy makers. Yet, their responsiveness to this signal (i.e., signaling benefits) and contribution incentives within the coalition (i.e., cooperation costs) are likely to vary with issue salience. This theory is tested on a unique data set comprising 50 issues in five European countries. Results reveal a strong moderating effect of salience on the relationship between coalition diversity and success: On less salient issues, homogenous coalitions are more likely to succeed, whereas the effect reverses with higher salience, where diverse coalitions are more successful.

Past models of food preference have assumed that social concerns are dissociated from basic appetitive qualities—such as tastiness—in food choice. In contrast to this notion, we tested and found support for the novel idea that social identities can shape the evaluation of food pleasantness. Specifically, individual differences in social identification (Study 1) as well as experimentally manipulated identity salience (Study 2) were associated with the anticipated tastiness of identity-relevant foods. We also found that identity salience influenced perceived food pleasantness during consumption (Study 3). These results suggest social identity may shape evaluations of food pleasantness, both through long-term motivational components of identification as well as short-term identity salience. Thus, the influence of social identity on cognition appears to extend beyond social evaluation, to hedonic experience.

In three experiments, we demonstrate that the framing effect is less pronounced in experience-than in description-based decisions. We explain this finding on the basis of affective forecasting with losses. In descriptive conditions, individuals overestimate the impact of potential losses on their emotional reactions, whereas experience helps people become aware of their ability to rationalize losses and mitigates this erroneous affective forecasting, thereby reducing the propensity for risk seeking.

The data from the current study, collected from 315 subjects (ns differed among analyses) and two measures of WMC, suggest that if WMC correlates with probe-caught mind wandering, the association is most likely negative. In addition, the evidence regarding self-caught mind wandering is consistent with that found by Levinson et al. for the sum of self-caught responses, but when self-caught responses were considered in proportion to probe-caught mind wandering, modest evidence was found for a positive association with WMC.",2019-05-01,2020-01-29T05:52:00Z,2020-01-29T05:52:13Z,2020-01-29T05:52:00Z,789-797,5,30,Psychol Sci,Is There a Positive Association Between Working Memory Capacity and Mind Wandering in a Low-Demand Breathing Task?,NA,en,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\C7LRXBYX\Meier - 2019 - Is There a Positive Association Between Working Me.pdf,NA,NA,replication; individual differences; open data; preregistered; cognitive control; mind wandering; working memory capacity,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001610,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\C7LRXBYX\Meier - 2019 - Is There a Positive Association Between Working Me.pdf,TRUE

This utilization of subliminal information was flexible and adapted to a change in cues predicting task switches and occurred only when switch trials were difficult and effortful. When cues were consciously visible, participants were unable to discern their relevance and could not use them to enhance switch performance.

If the revelation cost falls in a high range, the risk of whistleblowing convinces executives to restrain themselves. Executives cannot credibly commit to this when the costs are low, resulting in inefficient investigations from watchdog groups that tax executive resources.

The right posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is a region that has been associated most strongly with spatial remapping. The aim of the project was to investigate the effect of damage to the right PPC on direction specific trans-saccadic memory. We compared trans-saccadic memory performance for central items that had to be remembered while making a left- versus rightward eye movement, or for items that were remapped within the left versus right visual field. Methods We included 9 stroke patients with unilateral right PPC lesions and 31 healthy control subjects. Participants memorized the location of a briefly presented item, had to make one saccade (either towards the left or right, or upward or downward), and subsequently had to decide in what direction the probe had shifted. We used a staircase to adjust task difficulty (i.e., the distance between the memory item and probe). Bayesian repeated measures ANOVAs were used to compare left versus right eye movements and items in the left versus right visual field. Results In both conditions, patients with right PPC damage showed worse trans-saccadic memory performance compared to healthy control subjects (for the condition with left- and rightward gaze shifts, BF10 = 3.79; and when items were presented left or right, BF10 = 6.77), regardless of the direction of the gaze or the initial location of the memory item. At the individual level, none of the patients showed a direction specific deficit after leftward versus rightward saccades, whereas two patients showed worse performance for items in the left versus right visual field. Conclusion Damage in the right PPC did not lead to gaze direction specific impairments in trans-saccadic memory, but instead caused more general spatial memory impairments.",2019-11-01,2020-01-30T07:55:15Z,2020-01-30T11:13:08Z,2020-01-30T07:55:14Z,284-297,NA,120,Cortex,NA,NA,en,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\X8TQWJKM\Ten Brink et al. - 2019 - Trans-saccadic memory after right parietal brain d.pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\WDQSY6MH\S0010945219302370.html,NA,Constructional apraxia; Hemispatial neglect; Parietal cortex; Spatial remapping; Spatial working memory,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001624,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\X8TQWJKM\Ten Brink et al. - 2019 - Trans-saccadic memory after right parietal brain d.pdf,TRUE

In Study 1 (N = 179), UAPs, on average, related to greater negative-affect versus positive-affect induction helping tactics. In two experiments, UAPs, on average, related to a greater likelihood of selecting anger-inducing versus love-inducing or sadness-inducing songs to help a target overcome a breakup (Study 2; N = 313) and greater selection of anger-inducing and hubris-inducing messages versus authentic-pride-inducing and love-inducing messages to help a teammate struggling in a game (Study 3; N = 246).

Recent behavioral data suggest that high-priority items in working memory are more vulnerable to disruption. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to evaluate the hypothesis that prioritization of working memories might impact the recovery of their neural representation(s) after distraction. A delay-period retrospective cue informed participants which of two memory items (a face or a scene) to prioritize during a first delay period. Consistent with prior work, and confirming successful prioritization, multivoxel pattern classifier evidence in perceptual brain regions was higher for cued versus uncued memory items. A distraction task was then imposed before a second retrospective cue informed participants to either “stay” remembering the previously cued item or “switch” to the previously uncued item. This allowed for the evaluation of recovery for high-priority items (on stay trials) and also low-priority items (on switch trials). Classifiers showed successful reinstatement of both high- and low-priority items after distraction, but only low-priority items recovered to their pre-distraction representational levels. Moreover, the degree of prioritization before distraction predicted the amount of disruption for high-priority items after distraction, suggesting that the more a participant prioritized the cued item, the greater the impact of distraction.

Estimating two regression lines, one for low and one for high values of x, allows testing for a sign change without a functional-form assumption.

Or can a third party gain from involvement, even if its protégé leader is removed from power? We model external influence on the onset of protests and repression as a game between the government, the protesters, and a third party that supports the government.

Although anecdotes and experimental studies suggest that acquiescence occurs, the empirical case for acquiescence has not been definitively established. In four studies—using the ratio-bias paradigm, a lottery exchange game, blackjack, and a football coaching decision—we tested acquiescence using recently established criteria.

Despite their shared capacity for blame mitigation, here we focus on differences between historical and biological explanations for bad conduct. We argue that historical explanations generate greater uncertainty about blameworthiness than do biological explanations. They do so because they have both competing and tentative implications regarding agent control. Furthermore, we argue that the blame uncertainty engendered by historical explanations enables motivated cognition in the blame process. We provide evidence for these claims in four studies. In Study 1, we show that computer mouse trajectories are less direct—suggesting uncertainty—when blame assessments are made in cases of historical as compared to biological causation. Studies 2, 3, and 4 test our claims regarding susceptibility to biased cognition. Predisposition to blame was measured in Studies 2 and 3 and manipulated in Study 4. In all studies, predisposition to blame was more potent in shaping blame judgments in cases of historical as compared to biological causation. Evidence suggests that this happened because cases of historical causation are relatively amenable to divergent construals regarding agent control, whereas the implications of biological causation are more definitive. Discussion centers on the importance of motivation—a “merciful mindset”—for effecting blame mitigation in cases where the offender has endured an unfortunate life history.",2018-07-01,2019-03-30T16:25:27Z,2019-03-30T16:25:39Z,2019-03-30T16:25:27Z,11-23,NA,77,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,How much blame does he truly deserve?,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\PRPLBYER\Gill en Ungson - 2018 - How much blame does he truly deserve Historicist .pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\FSMM5LNF\S0022103117304869.html,NA,Blame; Blame mitigation; Historical and biological causes; Moral judgment,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2018,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001641,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\PRPLBYER\Gill en Ungson - 2018 - How much blame does he truly deserve Historicist .pdf,TRUE

We discuss evidence from a recent survey of journal editors suggesting that specialized statistical review may be unusual in psychology journals and is regarded by many editors as unnecessary. We contrast these views with those in the biomedical domain, where statistical review has been considered a partial preventive measure against the improper use of statistics since the late 1970s.

Individual differences in the resistance to social change were related to higher levels of perceived legitimacy no matter the level of inequality of the society. Conversely, individual differences in the acceptance of inequality were related to higher levels of perceived legitimacy in unequal societies, but either a relationship near zero or the opposite relationship was found in more equal societies.

In contrast to previous work which suggests that empathy does not shape the perceptions of injustice, the present research proposes that while perceptions of fairness in the context of injustice are dynamic, they may well be shaped by empathy. Using a dictator-style paradigm, the present research explored the extent to which empathy is related to perceptions of injustice and in turn, compensating forms of inequality. A non-registered Study 1 (N = 466) found that higher empathy predisposition is related to perceiving more injustice in contexts of inequality. Preregistered Study 2 (N = 406) extended this finding by experimentally manipulating empathy, showing that emphasising with the victim of inequality is indirectly related to perceiving injustice. The hypothesised mechanism, empathy allowing identification and experiencing the feelings of anger associated with the injustice, is supported in Study 2.

However, its specific contribution to simple motor response to sensory cue is still not completely clear. To investigate the role of PMv, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to interfere with its function during a simple reaction time (SRT) task. We ran two experiments where participants were required to respond as fast as possible to a median nerve stimulation (go-signal), while sub-M1-threshold single pulse TMS was delivered either on left (contralateral) PMv or right (ipsilateral to sensory stimulus and motor response) PMv, 5–65 ms after the go-signal. TMS delivered on either PMv up to 25 ms after the go-signal shortened reaction time. This is the time window compatible with the arrive of sensory afferences, as if conditioning before sensory afferences arrive lower the threshold needed to release the pre-planned motor program to the primary motor cortex.

This is puzzling, as stress and anxiety typically have deleterious effects on cognitive control and performance. The traditional explanation is that stress reduces “cue utilisation”: It withdraws attentional resources from less relevant stimuli (including the distracter word), meaning that the target colour is left with a stronger influence over response selection. However, it could also be that stress somehow boosts distracter inhibition, or some other aspect of executive control. To test these two accounts, 59 students completed a Stroop task featuring occasional startlingly loud sounds (high stress) or the same sounds at a lower, comfortable volume (low stress). Alongside standard Stroop interference, two measures of executive control—negative priming and conflict adaptation—were calculated from the Stroop data. Stress produced a clear reduction of Stroop interference, but it did not influence negative priming, and no conflict adaptation effects were detected at all. These findings support the cue utilisation account. Furthermore, for the first time, stress was shown to reduce Stroop interference in a task with no congruent trials, showing that the effect does not result from stress’s modulating any strategy changes participants might make in response to congruent trials.",2019-06-01,2020-02-05T06:05:25Z,2020-02-05T06:05:36Z,2020-02-05T06:05:25Z,1522-1529,6,72,Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology,Reduced Stroop interference under stress,NA,en,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\2H3KB9U3\Booth - 2019 - Reduced Stroop interference under stress Decrease.pdf,NA,NA,stress; cue utilisation; executive control; Stroop interference,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001658,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\2H3KB9U3\Booth - 2019 - Reduced Stroop interference under stress Decrease.pdf,TRUE

It is however poorly understood how perceptual decisions unfold in time when people discriminate the expression of emotions transmitted using dynamic facial and vocal signals, as in natural social context. In this study, we relied on a gating paradigm to track how the recognition of emotion expressions across the senses unfold over exposure time. We first demonstrate that across all emotions tested, a discriminatory decision is reached earlier with faces than with voices. Importantly, multisensory stimulation consistently reduced the required accumulation of perceptual evidences needed to reach correct discrimination (Isolation Point). We also observed that expressions with different emotional content provide cumulative evidence at different speeds, with “fear” being the expression with the fastest isolation point across the senses. Finally, the lack of correlation between the confusion patterns in response to facial and vocal signals across time suggest distinct relations between the discriminative features extracted from the two signals. Altogether, these results provide a comprehensive view on how auditory, visual and audiovisual information related to different emotion expressions accumulate in time, highlighting how multisensory context can fasten the discrimination process when minimal information is available.",2019-10-01,2020-01-30T07:37:49Z,2020-01-30T07:38:35Z,2020-01-30T07:37:49Z,184-194,NA,119,Cortex,NA,NA,en,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\3KWXAQRE\Falagiarda and Collignon - 2019 - Time-resolved discrimination of audio-visual emoti.pdf, C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\DFVC9WSC\S0010945219301856.html,NA,Voice; Emotions; Face; Gating; Multisensory,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001659,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\3KWXAQRE\Falagiarda and Collignon - 2019 - Time-resolved discrimination of audio-visual emoti.pdf,TRUE

In three experimental tasks commonly used to assess altruism, reciprocity, and trust in humans, we found no evidence in favor of the hypotheses; nine main tests were preregistered, and all of them yielded small and statistically insignificant estimates. In secondary analyses, we used Bayesian inference and estimation to quantify support for our findings.

We examine lay perceptions of virtue, and show that different psychological drivers of virtuous behavior are relevant for different types of actions. When evaluating non-moral virtuous behavior, such as choosing to skip dessert, attributions of virtue depend on perceived willpower (i.e., the extent to which someone overcomes temptation in service of acting virtuous). In contrast, when evaluating moral virtuous behavior, such as choosing to be faithful to a spouse, attributions of virtue depend on perceived purity (i.e., the extent to which someone lacks temptation to sin and thereby does not need to exert willpower in service of acting virtuously). Study 1 demonstrates that when people describe their own actions, they associate willpower with non-moral virtuous behavior, and purity with moral virtuous behavior. Studies 2 & 3 examine judgments of others and show that as behaviors become moralized, people elevate the importance of purity relative to willpower when ascribing virtue. Finally, Study 4 examines perceptions of those who are “reformed”—having eliminated their previous sinful desires such that they no longer feel tempted. For non-moral behaviors, reformed individuals are seen as strong-willed and thus highly virtuous. However, for moral behaviors, reformed individuals are still seen as somewhat impure, and are judged to be less virtuous than those have never felt tempted by a particular vice.
